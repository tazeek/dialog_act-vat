          " What ' s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . ",
          " Not for me , Dick . ",
          "Are things still going badly with your houseguest ? ",
          " Getting worse . Now he ' s eating me out of house and home . I ' Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . ",
          " Leo , I really think you ' re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ' s time to lay down the law . ",
          " You ' re right . Everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . I ' ll keep you informed . ",
          "Would you mind waiting a while ? ",
          " Well , how long will it be ? ",
          " I'm not sure . But I'll get a table ready as fast as I can . ",
          " OK . We'll wait . ",

          " According to some studies it may cause cancer . ",

          "Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ? ",
          " It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . ",
          " Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ? ",
          " News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on . ",
          " Is there anything interesting ? ",
          " Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education . ",
          " I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ? ",
          " Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs . ",
          " That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ? ",
          " Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals . ",
          " I got it . Do you pay for the programs ? ",
          " Yes , 50 Yuan per month . ",
          " It is a little bit expensive , but it's worth it . ",
          " Yeah . You know driving is boring . TV can get me out of the fatigue of driving . ",
          " It can also entertain your passengers like me . ",
          " That's the point . ",
          "Jenny , you're too lazy . You should do some exercise . See , you're getting fat . ",
          " Dad , it's raining outside . ",
          " That is your excuse . ",
          " All right , all right , I will go swimming with Peter this afternoon . ",
          " Not just today . Go exercise everyday ! ",
          "Peter , enough with your computer games . Go do your homework now . ",
          " Can't I play more ? ",
          " No ! Stop playing computer games ! ",
          " Mom , I'll be finished soon . ",
          " Peter , if you don't turn off your computer , then I won't allow you to play it again starting next week . ",
          "Hi , who has the remote control ? ",
          " I do . Why , do you want me to change the channel ? ",
          " Yes , please . I can't stand watching the channel any more . ",
          " I think they have pretty good programmes . But I'll change it if you really want . ",
          " Put it on Channel 5 , OK ? ",
          " Oh , I hate Channel 5 . I'd rather just listen to the radio . ",
          " Don't make such a fuss . I'm sure you will like today's programme . ",
          " What's on today ? ",
          " A basketball match between Chinese team and American team . ",
          " Really ? I'm interested in it . ",
          " It might begin now . ",
          "Peter , where are you going ? ",
          " I'm going to do some shopping . ",
          " Won't you watch TV ? ",
          " What's on TV tonight ? Is there a football match ? ",
          " The TV station will air the World Cup football match alive at 8: 30 . ",
          " Really ? Who will play ? ",
          " The Brazilian team versus the American team . Don't miss it . ",
          " That's cool . I'll watch it . ",
          " Who do you think will win ? ",
          " There is no doubt that the Brazilian team will win . ",
          " I think so . ",
          "May I have a cookie ? ",
          " Help yourself . ",
          "By the way , where's Jim ? ",
          " He is out . ",
          "Watch out ! ",
          " Wow ! That car almost hit me . ",
          "Eat some more . ",
          " No , thanks . I'm on a diet . ",
          "Hurry up , will you ? ",
          " What's the rush ? ",
          "Kata ! You've got a beautiful singing voice . You hit the high notes perfectly . ",
          " Thank you for your compliment . But you are exaggerating . I think you are destined to be a singer . You have the best voice ! ",
          " Thank you . Maybe we can sing a song together . Would you like to sing with me ? ",
          " Yes , I'd like to . It's my honor . Let's pick a song . ",
          " How about this one ? ",
          " Sorry , I can't sing the song . ",
          " Er ... How about this one ? ",
          " OK . But I'm not familiar . I don't know the beginning part . ",
          " Never mind . You can follow me . I'll sing the first part . ",
          " OK . ",
          "Peter , go and tidy up your toys now . ",
          " Wait a moment , mom . ",
          " I'm mad ! I said now ! Turn off the TV , and do it now . ",
          " Mom , just ten more minutes . The show is going to be over soon . ",
          " Peter , if you don't do it soon , I will throw your toys in the trash can . ",
          "Sorry , I'm late . ",
          " It doesn't matter . ",
          "Excuse me , I've been waiting here for 10 minutes . Do you know how often does No . 636 run ? ",
          " It runs every 15 minutes . You must have missed it . ",
          " It seems you got here at good time . Do you have a bus schedule ? ",
          " Yes , I do . You can buy a bus schedule in a news stand . ",
          " I see , thank you . By the way , is this the right bus for the Museum ? ",
          " Yes , it is . ",
          " Do I have to change ? ",
          " No . The Museum is the terminal of this bus . ",
          " Thanks a lot . ",
          " You are welcome . ",
          "Mom , can I have more allowance ? ",
          " What for ? ",
          " I want to buy more books . ",
          " Oh , yeah ? Are you joking ? ",
          " Of course not ! I'm telling the truth . ",
          " Honey , it's good if you spend money to buy more books . But $ 100 dollars a week is enough for you already . ",
          "Two burgers , please . ",
          " For here or to go ? ",
          "Dad , may I have a room of my own ? ",
          " Oh , honey , I'm so sorry , we don't have enough space for you to have your own room . ",
          " Dad , but I don't want to share a room with Peter . He snores every night . ",
          " Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ? ",
          " Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it . ",
          "Open the book and turn to page 10 . ",
          " It is difficult . ",
          " No , honey , it's easy if you know the way . ",
          " Do I have to memorize it ? ",
          " No , honey , try to make notes in your notebook . ",
          "Peter , wash your hands first , and then have some dessert . ",
          " Mom , can I have some ice cream ? ",
          " Not today , Honey . Don't eat too much ice cream . ",
          " Mom , can I have one more piece of cake ? ",
          " Ok . The last piece is for your dessert . We're having dinner soon . ",
          "Dad , can you help me ? ",
          " Oh , honey , you made a mistake . ",
          " I don't know how to do it . ",
          " OK . Let's do it together . ",
          " 16 divided by 2 . What's the answer ? ",
          " 16 divided by 2 equals 8 . ",
          " You got it . Good job . ",
          "How was your test ? ",
          " It was bad . ",
          " Oh , honey , you should study harder . ",
          " But I already tried my best . ",
          " Don't worry . You'll do better next time . ",
          "Is Bob home ? ",
          " Sorry . You've got the wrong number . ",
          "Dad , how do you say this word ? ",
          " Sword , say it ' sword ' . ",
          " What does this word mean ? ",
          " Look it up in the dictionary . ",
          " Dad , can you just tell me what it means ? I'm too lazy . ",
          " No , honey , go and read it . You'll learn . ",
          "Jenny , what's your favorite color ? ",
          " I like red . ",
          " Now , we're going to draw an apple in your sketch book . What do we use ? ",
          " Dad , I want to draw with crayons , can I ? ",
          " Why not ? Let's draw the outline of an apple with your pencil first . ",
          "Mom , my nose is bleeding . ",
          " What happened , Peter ? Did you have a fight ? ",
          " No , mom . I didn't . ",
          " Did somebody hit you ? Or did you just fall ? ",
          " Mom ! I was just picking my nose , and now it's bleeding . ",
          "Something's wrong with my air conditioning . ",
          " Leave it to me . I'll fix it . ",
          "Mom , I don't feel well . ",
          " Are you sick ? ",
          " I feel dizzy . ",
          " Let me take your temperature . ",
          " Mom , I don't want to go to see a doctor . ",
          " Oh , honey , I think you've caught a cold , you should get a shot . ",
          "What do you want to be ? ",
          " Dad , I haven't thought about it . I'm still young . ",
          " Oh , honey , but you must know what your hobby is , right ? ",
          " I like playing the piano . ",
          " Yes , you play the piano well . You could be a good pianist . That's good . ",
          "Where are you off to ? ",
          " The movies . ",
          "May I have the menu , please ? ",
          " Sure . Here you go . ",
          "Peter , do you want to learn to play the piano ? ",
          " No , mom . Piano is for girls . ",
          " Well , there are many boys that can play the piano very well , like Jay Chou . ",
          " No way , mom . I don't like piano . ",
          " OK . But you have to promise me that you will study hard in your English class . ",
          " All right , all right . I understand . ",
          "Jenny , Can you come and help me ? ",
          " Mom , what should I do ? ",
          " It's dusty everywhere in the house . Can you help me do the housecleaning ? ",
          " OK . I will call Peter to clean it together . ",
          " That's my good girl . The clothes need washing . I'll do the laundry . ",
          "Mom , what are we going to make tonight ? ",
          " Curry and rice . What do you think ? ",
          " That sounds nice . I can peel the potatoes first . ",
          " Really ! Oh , honey , you are so sweet . I'll chop up this carrot . ",
          " Mom , the water is boiling ! ",
          " Honey , just turn down the stove . ",
          "Can you make out what he's saying ? ",
          " No , it's too loud in here . ",
          "It's your turn now , Helen . ",
          " OK . I'm coming . ",
          " This is your song . I picked it for you . ",
          " Thank you . You are so considerate . ",
          " Push the red button on the mike to turn it on . ",
          " OK . This key is too high for me . ",
          " I think it's a piece of cake for you . ",
          " OK . Let me have a try ... ",
          " Well done ! I hope I can sing as well as you one day . ",
          " Thank you . I'm sure you will . ",
          " I hope so . Thank you for saying so . ",
          "Dinner's ready ! Come and get it ! ",
          " Coming ! ",
          "Have you got a minute ? ",
          " Sure . What's up ? ",
          "Who is the next one ? ",
          " It's Peter's turn . ",
          " Give the mike to him . ",
          " OK . ",
          " Be quiet . He is singing . ",
          " I thought he only liked to listen ! ",
          " So did I . ",
          " He has a really good voice ! ",
          " Yes , he sings wonderfully . ",
          "Can you pass me the lighter ? ",
          " Here . Catch ! ",
          "Have you ever sung with a karaoke ? ",
          " Yes , I do it quite often . ",
          " Karaoke has become a major entertainment . I wonder why . ",
          " Simple , it's fun . ",
          " How much fun is there in singing in front of other people , especially if you don't sing well ? ",
          " Ah , that's the biggest fun of all . You see , even though you're not a good singer , people will listen to you . ",
          " I wouldn't do that . ",
          " But I like the feeling . ",
          "What kind of music do you like ? ",
          " I like popular music best . ",
          " Me too . ",
          " Who is your favorite singer ? ",
          " Qi In is . ",
          " Do you know this song ? ",
          " Yes , I like it very much . ",
          " Let's sing it together , shall we ? ",
          " No problem . ",
          "Who's it for ? ",
          " It's for you . ",
          "How much does this cost ? ",
          " Sixty dollars . ",
          "May I use your phone ? ",
          " Go ahead . ",
          "Where's the toilet ? ",
          " Over there . ",
          "Watch out , Jenny ! Be careful of the cars . ",
          " I'm fine , dad . ",
          " Did you get hit ? ",
          " No , dad . Can I go there to play ball ? ",
          " Watch out for strangers , and don't go too far away . Alright ? ",
          "Do you shop online often ? ",
          " Every so often . It is very convenient and the price is lower than in stores . ",
          " Are there many things online ? ",
          " Books , cosmetics , daily necessities , even large electrical appliance can be ordered from online-stores . ",
          " Incredible . I really want to survey the on-line virtual supermarket . ",
          " Even you can bargain with the owner of one on-line store , although he or she provides ' But It Now ' prices . ",
          " What are the disadvantages of on-line shopping ? ",
          " Some provide wrong pictures for the goods , so many buyers are deceived . ",
          "Peter , it's time to go home now ! Hurry up ! ",
          " Ten more minutes , mom . Please ! ",
          " Honey , it's almost noon . We have to go home and make lunch for your sister . ",
          " I bet she will hang around with her mates after school . ",
          " Peter , it's a quarter to twelve . Let's go home now ! ",
          "Don't tell me you're pregnant again . ",
          " I'm afraid so . ",
          "I am keen on a coat on www.dingding.com . But it requires having an online banking account . Is it necessary ? ",
          " Indeed . Online banking enables you to make on-line shopping . ",
          " Do you know how to get the bank account ? ",
          " Bring your ID card and fill out a form . That will be fine . ",
          " So easy . ",
          " I think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than ATM processing speed . ",
          " My shopping life will be more convenient . ",
          "Honey , I need to have a talk with you . ",
          " Dad , I have to do my homework . ",
          " No , honey , why didn't you go to cram school last night ? ",
          " Dad , I don't want to talk about it now . ",
          " Honey , if you don't want to go to cram school , you should tell me the reason why . ",
          " I'm sorry , dad . But I would rather stay at school than go to cram school . ",
          "Do you have any plan to buy a house in this city ? ",
          " Absolutely we need a house here . But what makes me upset is the prices in this city . ",
          " Our monthly salary can not buy one square meter of the house here . ",
          " It is depressing to hear the price goes higher and higher . ",
          " More and more people need to buy houses , but the market can not meet the needs , so this caused the bubble in real estate industry . ",
          " And the rich still wants to buy more , even though they have at least one house to live . ",
          " Have you watched the TV series , Humble Abode ? ",
          " Yes , it displays some social problems and interprets the values of our white-collars . ",
          " I really , really want a house , even though it is small like a snail house . ",
          "Stop burping . ",
          " I can't help it . ",
          "Can you give me a hand ? ",
          " Of course . ",
          "Let's go now . ",
          " I'll be with you in a minute . ",
          "Kate , can we change the channel ? ",
          " Why ? ",
          " This channel has so many advertisements , and it doesn't have any good TV programs . ",
          " OK . You can change it . ",
          " What about this one ? Do you like this program ? ",
          " No , I think it is very boring . Can you change it to Channel Twelve , please ? ",
          " Yes . Oh , it's a talk show . ",
          " Yeah , it's very funny . Have you ever watched it before ? ",
          " No , I haven't . This is my first time to watch it . ",
          " I'm sure you will like it . ",
          "Mom , can I watch TV ? ",
          " No more today , honey . ",
          " Alright , Mom . Should I turn off the TV right now ? ",
          " Yes , honey . Go to your room , and take out your book . It's your reading time now . ",
          " Mom , where is the remote ? I can't find it . ",
          " Just go to read . I will find it , honey . ",
          "OK , Tom . It's your turn . Are you ready ? ",
          " I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ? ",
          " Come on ! In the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song ! ",
          " I know , but ... Hey , Jim's here ! I've been waiting to hear him sing all night . ",
          " Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him ? He loves ' The King ' . ",
          " I'll put the song at the front of the list . ",
          "Can you give me a hand with my luggage ? ",
          " Of course . ",
          "Peter , have you seen my purse ? ",
          " No , mom . I haven't seen it . ",
          " That's strange . It should be on the desk . ",
          " Mom , did you try the basket on your bicycle ? ",
          " Not yet . Let me see . ",
          "Hello , I'm sorry for calling this late . May I speak to Peter ? ",
          " I'm sorry . He's not in right now . ",
          " When is he coming back ? ",
          " He should be back in ten minutes . Could 1 you call back later ? ",
          " I'll call again in thirty minutes . ",
          "I received an E-mail from mother today . ",
          " What did she say ? ",
          " She missed us and asked when we would go back home . ",
          " What's your plan ? ",
          " I don't know . Maybe next week . We haven't been to the Great Wall yet . ",
          " Right , then you'd better send an E-mail to tell her . ",
          " All right . ",
          "These vegetables taste very sweet . ",
          " Sure , I planted them . They're organic . ",
          " Really ? Dad , how do you know how to plant organic vegetable ? ",
          " Well , it's a secret . ",
          " Dad , come on ! Just tell me . ",
          " Well , honey , I can teach you how to plant them if you want to learn . ",
          "Do you know anything about health food ? ",
          " It is so popular among people to preserve health now , so I read some books about health food . ",
          " Can you give me some examples ? ",
          " Drinking warm and fresh water in the morning on wakening up is one of ways to keep healthy . ",
          " Really ? Why we must have warm and fresh water ? ",
          " Warm water can be good for your stomach , which is empty at that moment . And freshness can keep the water active to clean your digest system . ",
          " Anything else ? ",
          " Yogurt , because it has protein , vitamins and it is acidic . If you drink it everyday , your stomach will be more comfortable . ",
          "Our dinner is ready . ",
          " What do we have for the dinner now ? ",
          " Potatoes , tomatoes and cucumber . ",
          " Do you feed rabbits ? ",
          " It is said that greens can improve our metabolism . In addition , I want to keep fit . ",
          " Where is my favorite white bread ? Is it in refrigerator ? ",

          " Wait . This is sounding like a major list . Why don't you just come with me ? ",
          "I want to get in shape . I feel like a fence sitter-not really fat , but not really healthy . ",
          " I know what you mean . I fit into my clothes , but I'm not always comfortable . ",
          " Would you like to get in shape together ? ",
          " What do you have in mind ? ",
          " How about going to the gym ? There's one really close to work . ",
          " I know the one you mean . Do you know how much the memberships are ? ",
          " As a matter of fact , they are having a promotion right now . ",
          " Let's go after work and take a tour of the facilities . ",
          "Ahahah ! What is that thing on your couch ! It just moved ! ",
          " Did you think it wasn't real ? That's my pet lizard . ",
          " You have a pet lizard ? Somehow I never would have imagined that . ",
          " His name is Grunt . Come closer and I'll properly introduce you . ",
          " Does it bite or scratch ? ",
          " No , he's perfectly harmless . And he's not afraid of strangers either . Here , hold him . ",
          " Wow . He's heavy ! And his skin feels really cool . ",
          " Stick around and you'll get to know him better . He has a very unusual personality . ",
          "Mom . I have to go school shopping . There's only one more week left . ",
          " Do you need money or what ? ",
          " I have this list of stuff that I need and I only have half the dough . ",
          " Half the dough huh . Well . How would you like to earn the other half ? ",
          " Do I have a choice ? Uh . That's a no . What can I do ? ",
          " I thought you'd never ask . The lawn needs to be mowed and the garage deserves to be cleaned . ",
          "We can't go that way , the road is blocked for the next few days . ",
          " Oh , that's right . They're filming a movie up there , aren't they ? ",
          " Some high speed chase scene , I think . ",
          " I wonder how all the businesses in the area feel about that . ",
          " I think that they get a pretty good payoff . ",
          " The movie company has to pay them ? ",
          " I don't know about all of that , but think about it , their business gets free publicity ! ",
          " Oh , yeah , they get to be in a movie for the whole world to see ! ",
          "May I help you , sir ? ",
          " Yes , I have many things to buy . I would like to choose the cleaning milk first . ",
          " All right . What is your type of skin ? ",
          " Dry . That's my problem . ",
          " You can use this . It has special effect for keeping your face moisturized . It has this lotion , as a gift attached . ",
          " Sounds good . What about shampoo ? I would like to buy the product that prevents scurf . ",
          " How about this one ? It is well-known for the effect of removing scurf . ",
          " Is it a newcomer ? ",
          " Yes , it is a new brand . ",
          " I do not care the brand as long as it works well . ",
          " Anything else ? ",
          " I want to buy the toothpaste , the brand of Jiajieshi . ",
          " Yes , here you are . ",
          "Welcome . May I help you ? ",
          " Use , I want a eye-shadow . ",
          " We have different colours of eye-shadow . May I know what colour you usually wear ? ",
          " Purple . But today , I'm thinking of buying one in a bright colour . ",
          " Yes , I see . How do you like this one ? ",
          " May I have a try ? ",
          " Certainly . ",
          " It's still too dark . Any brighter colours ? ",
          " Not from this brand , I'm afraid . ",
          " What about other brands ? ",
          " How about this one ? ",
          " Oh , that's the very thing I need . ",
          "Hey , Mom , look what I found ! ",
          " Good heavens ! Don't bring that frog in the house . ",
          "Who ate the cookies that were sitting here ? ",
          " I did , Mom . ",
          " Shame on you . I was saving them for your brother . ",
          "Can you tell me what's included in your warranty ? ",
          " Certainly . The product has a two-year guarantee . If it breaks down during that period we offer a replacement unit completely free of charge . Our products are very reliable but we recommend you take out an extended warranty . This covers you for a further two years . ",
          " I see . What does that include ? ",
          " It covers all parts and labour , except for normal wear and tear of course . ",
          " What sort of response time do you guarantee ? ",
          " Our engineers are on call 24 hours a day . We guarantee someone will be with you within four hours , but in practice it's often much sooner . ",
          " Are there any exclusions ? ",
          " Not really . It's a very comprehensive warranty . I ' ll put a copy in the post to you and you can read through the small print . ",
          "I'm so sorry about your brother , Mr . Wang . ",
          " Thanks , Jane . ",
          " If you need any help , just let me know . ",
          "I need something to wash this down . Is there any juice in the fridge ? ",
          " What is that ? It looks like something from a swamp ! ",
          " It's a green drink . It's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals . ",
          " You know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag . ",
          " The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins . ",
          " Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ? ",
          " It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day . ",
          " It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck . ",
          "Hey , young lady , get back here and have some breakfast . ",
          " Dad ! I don't have time ! I'll be late for school ! ",
          " You won't make it through the day without breakfast . ",
          " Dad , I never eat breakfast . ",
          " Breakfast is brain food . Maybe that's why your grades are Suffering . ",
          " Uh ! Dad ! ",
          " Don't ' Uh , Dad ' me . Sit down and have some lovely breakfast . ",
          " Alright . You win . Please pass the brain food . ",
          "What do you think about all the different diets that people go on ? ",
          " I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! ",
          " But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? ",
          " They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . ",
          " So you think it's OK for people who are dieting to eat chocolate , don't you ? ",
          " Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . ",
          " How about drinking soda ? ",
          " Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be treated seriously ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . ",
          " And have you ever tried taking vitamins ? ",
          " I used to take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . ",
          " How do you know so much about food and dieting ? ",
          " You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size that I am now ! ",
          "Would you like to have some icecream ? I've got a variety of flavors for you to choose from . I've got strawberry , peach , chocolate , coffee , vanilla and praline . ",
          " Wow ! So many choices you have ! I wish I could , but I just can't . I'm on a diet to lose weight . ",
          " Come on , just a bite . It doesn't really hurt to have just a bite . ",
          " I'd better not . Please don't tempt me . Please ! ",
          " Gee ! You are really strong-willed . ",
          " You're damn right . I'm not so easily coaxed into doing something that I think is wrong . ",
          " Well , I'd better not tempt you . Otherwise , if I give you a piece of cake , you might ask for a glass of milk . ",
          "Can you help me out , Chuck ? ",
          " Sure . What's it , Yvonne ? ",
          " I want to put my desk over there , but it's too heavy for me to move . ",
          " Okay , you take one end and I'll take the other . ",
          "It's time to go . Are you ready ? ",
          " Almost . Let me get my bag . ",
          "How do you put this seat back ? I know there is a lever somewhere . ",
          " What are you doing ? ",
          " I'm getting dressed , what does it look like ? ",
          " It looks like you are about to get dressed . Did you forget we are in a car on the road ? ",
          " I'm good at this . Nobody will see anything . ",
          " Are you kidding ? You're going to cause an accident just from people gawking ! ",
          " All right , pull over at that service station and I'll dress in the ladies ' room . ",
          " That will be my pleasure . ",
          "Mark , can you dress the twins for me while I take a shower ? ",
          " You don't know what you are asking ! ",
          " Please ! You can do it . Their clothes are all laid out on the bed . ",
          " Remember what happened last time ? ",
          " Are you referring to KC getting her head stuck in the pant leg ? ",
          " Yes . That was a bit terrifying for both of us . ",
          " Don't worry ! Today they are wearing dresses ! ",
          " Oh , in that case , sure ! Uh ... what are these long sock-looking things ? ",
          "Hello . Welcome ! ",
          " Hello . I'd like to have my nails manicured . ",
          " This way please . We offer multiple manicure services here . Do you want a full service ? ",
          " I don't need the full service . ",
          " But the full service will make your nails look much prettier and it is on discount now . ",
          " No , thanks . All I need is painting and polishing . ",
          " OK . Please sit down . I hope you will be satisfied with our service . ",
          " Thanks very much . ",
          "You have a lovely house , Jack . ",
          " Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately . ",
          " That's too bad . What problems are you having . ",
          " Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over . ",
          " I've studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ? ",
          " Go right ahead . ",
          " Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room ",
          " Wow , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions . ",
          " You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help . ",
          "Would you like a piece of birthday cake ? ",
          " No , thanks , I'll pass . It looks very tempting though . ",
          " I thought strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting was your favorite ? ",
          " It is . I'm on a diet and strawberry cream cheese cake is not on it . ",
          " A diet ? What for ? You are in great shape . ",
          " I went to the doctor the other day . My cholesterol is up . ",
          " Oooo . This sounds serious . ",
          " Not too serious . But he gave me a strict diet to help bring it down . ",
          "Are you ready to order yet , sir ? ",
          " Yes , I think so . I ' d like to have one medium steak , and a bottle of wine . ",
          " Yes , sir . It'll be a moment . ",
          " Ok . ",
          "Mom , are those tattoos on your brows ? ",
          " Uh , yes , they are . ",
          " Moooooommmmm ! You're so in ! Anything else you've been keeping from me ? ",
          " What ? ",
          " Any body piercing ? Stick out your tongue ! ",
          " Oh , for Pete's sake . This is cosmetic . My brows are falling out . I did this for convenience . ",
          " Come on mom . I'm your A ! Wait till the guys hear about this ! ",
          " Mike , don't even think about it ! ",
          "Oh , my god ! I look so old . I look as if I were 40 . I think it's time for some plastic surgeries . I'm tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . ",
          " I don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You'd better stop being so ridiculous . ",
          " Anyway I think I need a nose job and some breast implants as well . ",
          " I think you need to get a brain surgery . Honestly speaking , you look charming . ",
          " I know what you mean . I just want to make myself more attractive . ",
          " You are fine the way you are . Besides , plastic surgery hurts . ",
          " Really ? ",
          " Sure it is . So you'd better get rid of this idea . ",
          "I only want a little off the top and the sides and back to have clean lines . ",
          " Okay . Is your hair naturally curly or is it a perm ? ",
          " It's natural . My friend told me you know how to work with curls . ",
          " That's my specialty . Let me put this around your neck . ",
          " Do you have any product that controls frizz ? ",
          " With the cut I'll give you , we will minimize a lot of that . ",
          " Thank you ! ",
          " And when we're done , I'll show you some great stuff to take care of the rest . ",
          "What can I do for you ? ",
          " I am looking for cologne , small bottle . Can I see that one in the glass shelf ? ",
          " Yes , of course , this one costs 260 yuan . ",
          " It's too expensive . ",
          " If you think it's expensive . You can look at this one . ",
          " What's the difference between the two ? ",
          " It's difficult to explain . But this one is really cheap . ",
          " Let me see . ",
          "Excuse me , could you tell me how much is the lipstick ? ",
          " It costs only 25 yuan . ",
          " Oh , it's too expensive . Can't you make it any cheaper ? ",
          " The price is reasonable because the quality is super . ",
          " But the price is too high . ",
          " How much would you like it to be , then ? ",
          " What about 15 yuan ? ",
          " Let's meet half way , 20 yuan , OK ? ",
          " All right , I'll take it . ",
          " I think you've got a real bargain . ",
          " Thank you . ",
          "Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? ",
          " Good morning . I'm interested in antiques . Do you have any ? ",
          " Yes , we have a great variety of Chinese antiques . ",
          " What do you have ? ",
          " Well , we have some painting and some porcelain . Which do you like better ? ",
          " I'd like porcelain . ",
          " Good . How about the table set ? ",
          " Oh , it looks well . I like it very much . ",
          " It's made in Jingdezhen . ",
          " How much is it ? ",
          " One thousand eight hundred yuan . ",
          " It's not expensive . I'll take it . ",
          "Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ? ",
          " Can you show me some traditional Chinese arts and crafts ? ",
          " Maybe sandalwood fan is good . ",
          " Would you show me some ? ",
          " Of course . ",
          " They really smell fragrant . How much is a real sandalwood fan ? ",
          " The small ones are one hundred yuan for each . And the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan . ",
          " I'll take two small ones and a big one . ",
          " What else are you interested in ? ",
          " I'm afraid not . ",
          " OK . Here you are . ",
          "I would like to buy some local handcrafts as gifts to my friends and relatives . ",
          " There are many stores selling handcrafts in Paris . Our store is wellknown for vase , table wear and jewelry boxes . You can take your time and choose whatever you like . ",
          " Well , the tapestry is delicate and beautiful . ",
          " You have made an excellent choice , it is our newcomer . The tapestry is on hot sell with the design and quality . The design on it is traditional Paris architecture . ",
          " How much is it ? ",
          " 100 frances . ",
          " Mmm , it is reasonable . Look at this set of table wear , it is so beautiful ! ",
          " We have a piece of table clothing to go with it . It is a brocade one with pretty stars . ",
          " This silver vase is a good ornament for the living room . ",
          " You are right . ",
          " I will take the tapestry , the set of table wear and the vase . ",
          " OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now . ",
          " All right . I will take one . ",
          "Did you ever buy food from the snack stands near our hotel ? ",
          " Yes , several times . ",
          " How do you like them ? ",
          " Not bad . ",
          " I always have the temptation to eat something there . ",
          " Then , why didn't you do that ? ",
          " I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ? ",
          " Some of them , I think , are not good . ",
          " It doesn't taste good ? ",
          " No , I mean some of them are not clean enough . ",
          " That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ? ",
          " I judge by appearances . ",
          " I got it . I think it's worth trying . ",
          " It certainly is . ",
          " I'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things . ",
          " Don't try everything at one time , please . ",
          " I see . Thank you . ",
          "It is my first time coming to China . I want to buy something unique of China to my friends as gifts . ",
          " We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ? ",
          " Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them . ",
          " You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ? ",
          " Sounds good . May I have a look ? ",
          " Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on . ",
          " They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs . ",
          " All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality . ",
          " Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ? ",
          " This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac . ",
          " Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones . ",
          " OK , I will wrap them for you . ",
          "Is there anything I can do for you ? ",
          " Would you please show me that mural ? ",
          " Certainly . Here you are . ",
          " It looks so beautiful . How much is it ? ",
          " Four hundred yuan . ",
          " That's a bit more than I wanted to pay . Can you cut the price down a bit ? ",
          " I'm sorry . Ours is a fixed price shop and I can assure you this is the best price you can get for a mural like this . ",
          " Maybe you are right . OK , I'll take it . ",
          " Well , I'll have it wrapped for you . ",
          " Thank you . Here is four hundred yuan . ",
          " Thank you . Please come again . ",
          "Mom , is there anything in the fridge I can eat before dinner ? ",
          " There's some leftover pizza from last night . ",
          " Anything else ? ",
          " Um , I think there may be some leftover lasagna from the other day . ",
          " Do I have any other choices ? ",
          " There might be some birthday cake left in the freezer . ",
          " Is everything in the fridge leftovers ? I hate leftovers ! ",
          " You can wash the vegetables and cut the chicken and I'll make dinner ! ",
          "You are looking really healthy lately . What are you doing differently ? ",
          " Thank you for noticing ! I've been making a few lifestyle changes over the past year . ",
          " Tell me about it . I'm interested . ",
          " Well , it all started when my brother challenged me to quit smoking . ",
          " Ha ! That's right . You used to smoke . I forgot ! ",
          " When I kicked that habit , I found I had so much more energy . I started exercising . ",
          " At the gym ? ",
          " No . I like to be outside . I took up hiking and mountain biking . ",
          "Yes ! I finally lost that last five pounds I've been working on forever ! ",
          " How did you finally do it ? ",
          " A friend suggested that I stop nibbling between meals . ",
          " Like snacking ? ",
          " You know , a little piece of chocolate here , some chips on the side , candy now and then ... ",
          " I get what you mean . ",
          " Instead , I sit down and have a good snack like a piece of fruit between meals . ",
          " I'm impressed . Good for you ! ",
          "This book I'm reading about Yoga is really interesting . ",
          " I didn't know you did Yoga . ",
          " I don't really practice it regularly yet , I'm just learning about it . ",
          " What have you learned ? ",
          " Right now I'm learning about the importance of breathing slow , deep and regularly . ",
          " As opposed to short and shallow ? ",
          " Yes . It says here , ' He who only half breathes , half lives . ' ",
          " I read something like that once . I think it was , ' Life is in the breath . ' ",
          "Good evening , madam . May I help you ? ",
          " I want a facial . But this is the first time I've come here , so can you tell me how you do it ? ",
          " Sure . Most facials start with a thorough cleaning . Then we usually use a toner to invigorate the skin , followed by exfoliation treatment-a peeling mask or scrub that removes the dead cells that make the skin lock dull . After that , we'll massage your face and neck with oil or cream to improve the circulation and relieve the tension , followed by a mask to moisturize and soften the skin . ",
          " That's exactly what I want . How long does it take ? ",
          " We have half-hour and one-hour treatments . ",
          " What's the regular price ? ",
          " Well , the half-hour facial costs 50 yuan and the one-hour costs 80 yuan . If you want make-up , another 20 yuan will do . ",
          " Good , I will take the one hour facial with make-up . ",
          " That's fine , madam . ",
          " By the way , could you give me a manicure ? Use a light nail-polish , please . ",
          " Yes , madam . ",
          "Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ? ",
          " I don't want to . ",
          " Well , come over and talk to me then . ",
          " Certainly not . ",
          " May I turn on the TV then ? ",
          " Turn on the TV , for what ? ",
          " So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . ",
          " Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? ",
          " I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner . ",
          " To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it . ",
          "Where is your dressing room ? ",
          " Right over there . ",
          " ( Person A comes out of the dressing room ) How did you like the sweater ? ",
          " I loved it . I'll take it . ",
          " Great . I can ring you up over here . It comes to $ 87.04 . ",
          " Here you go ? ",
          " Do you have a credit card with us ? ",
          " No I don't . ",
          " If you open up a card , you can save 10 % on all your purchases today . ",
          " Not today . Thanks though . ",
          " No problem . We always have this offer , so when ever you decide to , just let us know . ",
          " Sure . ",
          " Is there anything else I can help you with ? ",
          " Yeah . I was looking at some of your pants , but they are all a bit too long . Do you have alteration services here ? ",
          " Yes . It cost $ 7 , and it takes one day . ",
          " Great . Thanks for your help . ",
          " Thank you , and have a great day . ",
          "We have reservations for two at your restaurant tonight . ",
          " Yes , What can I do for you , sir ? ",
          " I'm calling to see if I can request a specific table . ",
          " I can try to arrange that for you . ",
          " I proposed to my wife in your restaurant and I would like the same table if I can . ",
          " Can you describe for me , where you were sitting ? ",
          " It was a little table by the bay windows overlooking the wharf . ",
          " You're in luck . We still have that little table . ",
          "Hi . Can I help you with anything ? ",
          " Yeah . Can I look at this ring ? ",
          " Sure . Let me get it out for you . What is your size ? ",
          " I believe I am a six . ",
          " Here you go . ",
          " Would you have any necklace that would go well with this ? ",
          " Actually , we have a few to choose from . They are over here . ",
          " There's no price tag on this necklace . ",
          " Oh . I'm sorry . I'll check the price for you . It is $ 199 . ",
          " This necklace is a little short . Do you have one that is longer ? ",
          " Yes . Why don't you try this one on . ",
          " This one is much better . Can I try on the ring with this necklace ? ",
          " Sure . Here you go . ",
          " Let me think about it . ",
          " Sure . Take your time . ",
          " Thank you for all the help . ",
          " No problem at all . ",
          "The portions here are man sized . We usually end up taking half of the meal home with us . ",
          " Everything looks so good . Is there anything in particular that you recommend ? ",
          " Hey , sis . You know me , if I don't like everything on the menu , I don't go back to the restaurant ! ",
          " So you're saying I can't go wrong with anything I order ? In that case ... ",
          " Wait , you love salmon , don't you ? They have the best salmon pasta . ",
          " That sounds really good ! Does it come with a soup ? ",
          " Soup and bread and salad bar ! I'm telling you , these people know how to keep you coming back ! ",
          " I see what you mean ! ",
          "I've never been to a restaurant like this before . ",
          " It's really different , isn't it ? ",
          " That's a good word to describe it . ",
          " I hope you're hungry because the pizza here is huge as well as to die for . ",
          " I am hungry . I think I could eat a large by myself . ",
          " Well , let's order one for starters . ",
          " I'm in the mood for a Californian . ",
          " That happens to be my favorite . Waiter , I think we're ready to order . ",
          "Dad , what are we doing tonight for fun ? ",
          " We're going over to Mrs . Smith's place to help her with her yard work . ",
          " Yard work ? I said ' what are we doing for fun ' , not work ! ",
          " It will be fun . And besides , you'll be in the best company . ",
          " Dad . You're so cute . What do I need to do to help get ready ? ",
          " You could get the rakes and some shovels together and I'll put them in the car . ",
          " Jeans and a tee shirt , right ? ",
          " Yes and maybe a jacket in case it gets cool . ",
          "Ah , here we are . ",
          " This is the place I was telling you about . ",
          " Would you like to sit near the window ? ",
          " Good . ",
          " Let's have a look at the menu . Oh , there isn't a menu . Do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ? ",
          " Yes , of course . Excuse me . Could you possibly let us see your menu ? Oh . They haven't got one either . ",
          "What can I get for you today , sir ? ",
          " I would like a cup of decaf with cream and no sugar . ",
          " Would you like anything else with that ? ",
          " How fresh is that apple pie over there ? ",
          " Our pie is brought in fresh every day . And I can tell you it's delicious . ",
          " Okay , throw in a piece of that pie then . ",
          " Is this to stay or to go ? ",
          " I'm in a bit of a hurry today , so we'd better make it to go . Thanks for asking . ",
          "Excuse me . Can I ask you a question ? ",
          " Sure . What is it ? ",
          " I don't know how to say it in English . ",
          " We call this a ' parking meter ' . ",
          " Oh , Thank you . But how do you spell it ? ",
          " P-a-r-k-i-n-g m-e-t-e-r . ",
          "Would you mind giving me a hand ? ",
          " Okay , Bob , What is it ? ",
          " Help me hang up this picture , please . Would you hold it straight while I put in the nail ? ",
          " All right . ",
          " Now , hand me the hammer and those nails , please . ",
          " Yes , here you are . ",
          " There ! How does it look ? Tell me if I've got it straight . ",
          " Well , it's straight , but it's upside down I'm afraid . ",
          "Mom , I want to get a motorcycle . Is that all right with you ? ",
          " You mean a murder cycle ? Did you know more cyclists die in accidents than motorists ? ",
          " Mom ! I'll wear a helmet and I'll drive sane . I promise . ",
          " I'll tell you what . You can get a motorcycle on one condition . ",
          " What's that ? ",
          " You spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an EMT trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month . ",
          " And after that ? ",
          " After that , we'll let you decide if you still want a murder , I mean motorcycle . ",
          "Did you hear about that accident on the 5 ? There was a sixty-two-car pile up . ",
          " No kidding ! When did that happen ? ",
          " Early this morning . ",
          " Oh , no . ",
          " Yeah . And a semi jack-knifed trying to miss a stalled car in the fast lane . You can imagine what happened after that . ",
          " Sixty two cars . Oath . Do they know how many casualties yet ? ",
          " The count is up to seven right now and several are in critical condition . ",
          " That's amazingly low for such a huge accident ! ",
          "Honey , I think I need to go see the doctor . ",
          " Ah ! You're bleeding all over ! What happened ? ",
          " I was working in the garage and cut myself with my saw . ",
          " Here , use this rag to apply pressure to the cut . Does it hurt ? ",
          " No , not really , there's just a lot of blood . ",
          " You may just need stitches . I think they can handle this at the clinic instead of the ER . Let me make a quick phone call . ",
          " I'm going to go sit in the car while I still have the stomach to walk . ",
          " Oh , sorry ! I forgot you get queasy with the sight of blood . I'll be right there . ",
          "This is 911 . ",
          " Send an ambulance fast ! My husband is having a heart attack ! ",
          " Slow down and tell me your address . ",
          " I live on 1177 Oak lane in Smithfield . Oh , hurry , I don't know what to do ! ",
          " An ambulance is on its way right now . They should be there any minute . Are you close to him right now ? ",
          " yes , yes , he's right here by me . ",
          " Is he breathing ? ",
          " Yes , he's breathing , but he's not conscious ! Oh , please hurry ! ",
          "Bob , would you come and help me ? ",
          " Of course . What do you want me to do , Mom ? ",
          " Could you hold these packages while I look for the key ? ",
          " Alright , what's in them ? They are so heavy ! ",
          " Just things we need for the picnic tomorrow . ",
          " Well , hurry up and open the door please . I told you these things are heavy . ",
          " I'm sorry , but I just can't find the key . You must have it . ",
          " Oh , yes , it's in my pocket . But how can I get the key while I'm holding all these bags ? ",
          "Hello , Miao Li , Where are you going ? ",
          " Hello , I am going to the store to buy some fruit . ",

          " Here are the letter and the money . ",
          " Wait a moment . It seems that your letter is overweight . Let me weight it . ",
          " Is it overweight ? ",
          " I'm afraid it is . So you will have to pay two yuan extra . The total charge is four yuan . ",
          " All right . Here is the money . ",
          " Here are the stamps and your receipt . ",
          " What shall I do with the receipt ? ",
          " You can keep it until the addressee tells you that the letter has been delivered . It is the proof that you sent the letter if it fails to arrive . ",

          " You can take one tonic or hand cream . ",
          " I will choose the tonic . ",
          " No problem . You can try this kind of gel which can prevent freckle , the effect will be better if you use this powder foundation applied with it . ",
          " That's the very thing I want . ",
          "Excuse me . Can you show me some nail-polish ? ",

          " A candy bar for an appetizer and a piece of pie for lunch ! That's all junk ! ",

          " That's cool . I bet you could bring your own food . ",
          " We did . On hot days , we'd take a blanket and lay in the back of dad's old pickup to watch the movie . ",
          " Why don't we do that anymore ? ",
          " Well , the weather might have some influence , during bad weather the theater didn't make a whole lot . ",
          "Do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for ? ",
          " Yes , G stands for General Audiences , PG means Parental Guidance suggested , R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content . ",
          " Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ? ",
          " Remember when we were kids ? Theaters wouldn't let kids in to PG moves without a parent . ",
          " I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed . ",
          " Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter . ",
          " Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either . ",
          " Now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't . ",

          " No problem . First , it's comfortable and cozy . Second , it has a lovely view of the city . Third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient . ",
          " There is something in what you said , but what is the rent ? ",
          " 200 dollars per week . ",
          " In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas . ",
          " It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent . ",
          " Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself . ",

          " Twice a week for work and once for shopping . ",

          " Moon cakes ? What is that ? ",
          " The moon cake is round and looks like the full moon . That's why it's called the moon cake and the moon cake symbolizes family reunion and harmony . ",
          " Sounds very interesting . I'll buy some to family people . ",
          " All the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles , Cantonese style and Suzhou style . ",

          " The skin of Cantonese style cakes is soft and puffy with heavy stuffing while the skin of Suzhou style cakes is puffy filled with fragrant nuts . ",

          " I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising , I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months . ",
          " That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ? ",
          " Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day . ",
          " That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ? ",
          " Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate . ",
          " That makes sense . I'm going to try that . ",
          " You don't need to lose weight . ",
          " I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of . ",
          " Ah ... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet . ",
          " Thanks for the advice . ",
          " No problem . ",

          " I think I will . ",
          "Nathan said he didn't have any fun at his new school this week . Do you know why ? ",
          " I think he hasn't made any new friends yet . He's just a little lonely . ",
          " He really misses his friends from our old neighborhood . ",
          " Without a doubt . Maybe if he knew he doesn't have to give up any of his old friends to make new ones , it will be easier for him . ",
          " How do you propose to help him understand that ? ",
          " Well , we can help him keep in touch with his old friends . ",
          " I guess we could go visit once in a while too . ",
          " Yeah . There's a lot we can do to help him through this transition . ",
          "Oops ! ",
          " What happened ? ",
          " I overcooked the corn . ",
          " That's okay . I like it better that way anyway . ",

          " No problem . Who is it ? Anyone I know ? ",
          " I don't think so . Do you remember Bob Gain from Tulsa ? ",
          " That name doesn't ring a bell . But tell me more . ",
          " He was on the diving team with me in high school and saved my life one day . ",
          " Well , I'll have to personally thank him by making him my famous chocolate cake . ",
          " You're glad he saved me , huh ? ",
          " Absolutely ! Bob and his whole family are welcome here any time ! ",
          "Can you believe her ? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet . ",
          " Tell me about it . If I was as small as her , I wouldn't think about going on a diet . ",
          " Me too . But what are we going to do ? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight . ",
          " That's because you don't exercise . If you were more active , you wouldn't have a dieting problem . ",
          " What do you know ? You are over weight too . ",
          " I'm not on a diet though . ",
          " I know . But I don't have someone to diet with . If we help each other and motivate each other , then I think we can lose some weight . ",
          " I like ice cream too much though . ",
          " C'mon . You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there . ",

          " It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed . ",
          " Okay . I'm in . Let's do it . ",
          " Great . I'll get our plan started right away . ",

          " I'm still not sure . The type with top quality , I guess . Well , which one do you recommend ? ",
          " Do you prefer imported ones or domestic ones ? ",
          " It doesn't matter much . If it has high quality and reasonable price , it will be OK . ",
          " How about Flymo ? It's selling well . ",
          " Do you have a warranty on it ? ",
          " Of course . The warranty period is one year . ",
          " If there's something wrong with it in a week , can I come back to change it ? ",

          " I watered all the plants . ",

          " That's true . ",
          " If you don't like beer , have you tried mixed drinks ? Some of them are pretty good . ",
          " I like beer , it's just that I get a headache when I drink more than 3 . ",
          " You just have to build up a tolerance . I used to be like that . But your body gets used to it . ",
          " It'll take awhile , but I'm working on it . ",

          " Please cut the sides shorter , but not so much at the back . ",
          " It's such a hot season , isn't it ? May I suggest thinning out the top ? ",
          " That's a good idea . But leave the front as it is now . ",

          " Yes . They are over there . ",
          " Do you sell them individually or by weight ? ",
          " By weight . 6.0 cents per pound . ",
          " Could you weigh these , please ? ",

          " It does smell good , How much is it ? ",
          " It goes for $ 40 . ",
          " OK . I'll take this one . ",
          "Here is your spicy diced chicken with peanuts , sir . ",
          " Thank you . It looks very attractive . ",
          " I would advise you to enjoy the dish while it is hot . ",
          " Tasty and tender ! It must be one of the famous local dishes . ",
          " Yes . It's a traditional dish . ",
          " And it must be very particular in cooking . ",
          " You are right , sir . To prepare it , a Sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn reddish brown , and then puts diced chicken breast meat into the pot with other condiments and peanuts . That's why the dish has a bright colour . ",
          " I see . ",
          " Enjoy yourself , sir . ",
          "What kind of cuisine do you have ? ",
          " We have Sichuan food , Hangzhou food and Beijing Food . Which do you like best ? ",

          " Yes , I like using chopsticks . ",
          " Do you like some soup ? ",
          " Yes , but I don't know what soup you have . ",
          " We have beef soup and tomato soup . ",
          " Good . I prefer beef soup . ",
          " According to usual practices , we serve dishes first and then soup . If you like we'll bring you some soup first . ",
          " Save it until you've served dishes . ",
          " All right . I'll be back right away . ",
          "Taxi . ",
          " Yes , sir , where are you going ? ",
          " I am going to the railway station . ",
          " Get on , please . ",
          " Thank you . Can we get there in half an hour ? ",
          " I am not sure , sir . Generally we can , but look at the traffic . It's the rush hour . ",
          " My train will leave at 3:00 , I'll have to arrive there before 2:50 . ",
          " We are really in a hurry . ",
          " Can't we go faster ? ",
          " I'll do my best . ",
          "Can you show me how to use chopsticks ? ",
          " With pleasure . ",
          " Oh , it is not easy to learn ! ",
          " I think you are a quick learner . ",
          " Well , I don't think I can manage with it . ",
          " In that case , shall I ask the waiter to bring you a knife and fork ? ",
          " That's good , thank you . ",
          "May I help you ? ",
          " Is this the right counter for gloves ? ",
          " Yes , madam . What sort of gloves do you want ? ",
          " Well , let me see some of each . ",
          " Certainly . What size do you take ? ",
          " Six and a quarter , I believe , but you'd better measure my hand to make sure . ",
          " I think a six is your size . How do you like these ? I can recommend them , they're very reliable . ",
          " Very well , I'll take these two . ",
          "May I take your order now ? ",
          " Yes , I'll have a boiled egg with toast and orange juice , please . ",
          " How would you like your eggs ? ",
          " Hard-boiled , please . ",
          " And your toast , light or dark ? ",
          " Dark , please . ",
          " Now or later ? ",
          " Later will do . ",
          " Will there be anything else ? ",
          " No , that's all . Thanks . ",
          " One hard-boiled egg with toast and orange juice to follow . ",
          " That's right . ",
          " Just a moment , please . ",
          "May I have a reservation ? ",
          " Yes , of course . ",
          " I've got three guests today . We'd like a table next to the window . ",
          " All right . Your name , please . ",
          " I'm Chen Liang . ",
          " Chen Liang , a table for four . And when are you coming ? ",
          " We may come at 6:30 p . m . ",
          " OK . We look forward to seeing you . Goodbye . ",
          " Goodbye . ",
          "What are you doing ? ",
          " I'm watching TV . ",
          " Are there any good programs on TV ? ",
          " Tingling is on TV . ",
          " Which Channel is it ? ",
          " Channel 8 . ",
          " It doesn't seem quite interesting . Would you change the channel ? ",
          "I think we should do the floors before we work on the curtains and walls . ",
          " Why ? it doesn't make sense . If we do the floors first , and then paint the walls , we will get paint all over our new floor . ",
          " Hmm Maybe you're right . But I can't stand all this green carpet here . And besides , I know how to paint . I will just cover everything with drop cloth . I won't get anything on the floor . ",
          " Are you sure ? ",
          " Yes , I'm sure I've done a lot of house painting in my life . And my mother was very picky . If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . So I learned to be very careful . ",
          " Alright . Then maybe we can do the floor first . These wood floors under this carpet are beautiful . And me too â€” â€” I can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here . But how can we get it out ? Do we have to hire someone ? ",
          " Absolutely not . We can remove the carpet ourselves . Carpet is held down with carpet nails . You just need to pull it hard and it will come up . ",
          " Great . Then , after we remove the carpet , we need to redo all the wood floors . Right ? ",
          " Yes . But we should hire someone for that . That will probably be expensive . And it has to be done right . ",
          " And then , after the floors are done , we can start to move our furniture in . ",
          " Sure . If we can get an appointment with someone to do the floors , we should probably be able to have the furniture in here after a week or so . I can get all the carpet out this weekend . ",
          "Hello , is that the Peace Restaurant ? ",
          " Yes . May I help you ? ",
          " Yes . I'd like a table for six at 7:00 this evening . Can you arrange it for us ? ",
          " Just a minute . I'll check if there is any availability . I'm sorry , sir . There isn't any table left for 7:00 , but we can give you one at 8: 00 . Would you like to make a reservation at that time ? ",
          " Let me see . It seems a little late . ",
          " Usually , the restaurant will be quieter at that time . ",
          " OK . I'll change the time to 8: 00 . ",
          " Very good , sir . A table for 6 at 8: 00 this evening . May I have your name , please ? ",
          " It's John . ",
          " Thank you very much . Bye . ",
          "Do you live in the red house at the end of the road ? ",
          " Yes , I live in that house with my parents and my sister . ",
          " We also have a cat and a dog . ",
          " Do you take your dog for a walk every day ? ",
          " No . My father takes the dog for a walk every Monday , Tuesday and Sunday . ",
          " And I take the dog for a walk every Wednesday , Thursday and Friday . ",
          " Who takes the dog on Saturday ? ",
          " On Saturday we all go to the park and the dog comes with us . ",
          " Do you help with the housework ? ",
          " My mum and my sister do the housework and cooking but I clean my room . ",
          "You're right . Watching movies at home is way cheaper than going to the theater , too . I like downloading movies too because it's easy and fast . ",
          " I agree . And it's very convenient . ",
          " Have you ever heard of a movie rental company called Netflix ? They send the movies directly to your house in the mail . ",
          " Really ? That's great ! I'm going to try that next time . ",
          " Yeah , but I wish they delivered video games too . Then I would never leave my house ! ",
          "Good evening , Saliva . What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ? ",
          " I am cooking now ! ",
          " Are you good at cooking ? ",
          " I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking ! ",
          " It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? ! ",
          " I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ? ",
          " Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty . ",
          " That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much . ",
          " I have the same idea as yours . ",
          " It's OK . Please have a taste of it . ",
          " Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious . ",
          " Thank you for your praise . ",
          " Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ? ",
          " I am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc . ",
          " So many dishes . Next Friday week is my birthday . I would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , OK ? ",
          " Why not ? It is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking . ",
          " Thanks a lot . ",
          " It's my pleasure . ",
          "Alright , tell me what you think about this one . ",
          " Don't you think it's a bit bright ? ",
          " Yeah , maybe you're right . How about this outfit ? ",
          " That dress looks lovely on you , but it's not very practical , is it ? ",
          " No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just want to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It's casual , yet sophisticated . ",
          " I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It's too plain on its own . ",
          " How about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ? ",
          " That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ? ",
          " That's a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense . ",
          " Thanks . You'd be OK on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? ",
          " Yep . Here it is . What do you think ? ",
          " That looks great . Just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? ",
          " The leopard print sounds fabulous . OK , I'll take it . ",
          "Can I borrow this magazine from you ? It's really interesting and I can't put it down . ",
          " I am sorry , but I can't lend it to you now , for I haven't finished reading it . If you don't mind , I can lend you some back numbers to you . ",
          " That would be very kind of you . By the way , is it a monthly magazine ? ",
          " No , it is a fortnightly . So , you see , I can get the new one quite soon . ",
          "Boy , come here ! ",
          " Yes , sir ! What can I do for you ? ",
          " Bring me a cup of coffee , please . ",
          " Will you have it strong or weak ? ",
          " I prefer strong . ",
          "Won't you have some of this ? ",
          " Yes , thanks . ",
          " It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue . ",
          " It's very good . How do you make it ? ",
          " I use a special dressing and homemade catsup . ",
          " This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day . ",

          " You Americans usually have nutritious food . ",
          " Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ? ",
          " We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience . ",
          " I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did . She was a great cook . She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night . ",
          "Here , Let me get the door for you . ",
          " Thanks . ",
          " Do you need a hand with that ? ",
          " Actually , I could use some help . Thank you so much . ",
          " Don't worry about it . ",
          "Doctor , my child is nine years old , and I recently found that he was constantly telling lies about how he is doing at school . ",
          " Is he doing very well at school ? ",
          " He is doing OK , but he pretends he is doing much better by telling lies . ",
          " What's his problem ? ",
          " This may be complicated . But I think he may need to build up his self-esteem . ",
          " How can his he do that ? ",
          " There are a lot of ways to help a kid build up self-esteem , but to begin with , you can try and give him more rewards . Rewards will help a chil improve his self-esteem . ",
          "Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive . ",
          " What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them . ",
          " But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past . ",
          " Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds . ",
          "There are many new kinds of newspapers . I find it hard to choose among them . Which is the most popular paper circulating in our city ? ",
          " I'd recommend you the Morning Paper , it is true that the paper is a newly issued one , but its circulation is rising . Last month , it reached to three hundred thousand , which is a very good figure for a new paper . ",
          " What's the reason that people prefer to read this one ? ",
          " I think perhaps the news stories in it are truthful and accurate . It also has a special page about the stock market ; maybe this is the real reason for its popularity . Many people are now speculating in the stock market . ",
          " I can predict it will have the largest circulation in one or two years . ",

          " All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up . ",
          " I will . Thank you , Mummy . ",
          "There are thousands of magazines published in the world to meet the needs of different readers . But only a few of them are influential world-wide . ",
          " You have hit the point . It's really hard for a magazine to be well known to people of various ages and educational backgrounds . ",
          " But I think Digest is supposed to be the top one . Its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . It's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it . ",

          " We are happy to help you . May I know which one it is ? ",
          " The two-bedroom apartment on 38th east street . ",

          " That's why I think it may suit my needs . ",
          " I believe it will . It comes furnished . You can move in immediately after the lease is signed . ",
          " The ad says the rent would be 840 dollars per month . Is it true ? ",
          " Yes . But not including the utilities . ",
          " Will it possible for me to rent the apartment on a month-by-month basis ? ",
          " I believe that can be arranged . But there should be a refundable security deposit , you know . ",
          " Oh , that's no problem . ",
          "How much is the rent ? ",
          " The rent is $ 1500 per month . ",
          " And how much is the deposit ? ",
          " The deposit is $ 500 . ",
          "Mmm ... it is delicious . ",

          " Well , it's kind of you to say so . ",
          " In fact , could I ask you for the recipe ? ",
          " Sure . It's really very easy . First , mix together an egg , two teaspoons of salt , and two pounds of ground beef . Then , add two ounces of milk . Are you with me ? ",
          " Yes , I've got it . ",
          " OK . Next , put the mixture into a baking pan and bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees . ",
          " Wait a minute . I didn't catch you there . Could you repeat that ? ",
          " Sure . Bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees . ",

          "Hello , who's that speaking ? ",
          " I am calling about the advertisement for a flat with a bedroom . Do you still have it now ? ",
          " Yes , I do . ",

          " It's in International Trade Zone . It's only ten minutes ' walk from the nearest subway station . ",
          " That's great . But can you make the rent cheaper , let's see , 12,000 Yuan ? ",
          " The price can be talked over . How about coming around and taking a look at it first ? ",
          " OK . I will be free at tomorrow afternoon . I'll take a taxi to get there . ",

          "Hey Sarah , I'm having some trouble finding an apartment . Can you help me look at some listings online ? ",
          " Sure . What kind of apartment are you looking for ? ",
          " Well , it has to be cheap . I don't want a really expensive apartment . ",
          " OK . Would you like to live in a studio ? ",
          " Sure , a studio would be fine . ",
          "Jeff , look at this listing ! It says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . What do you think ? ",
          " Well I think I can afford that apartment . But are pets allowed ? ",
          " Hmm ... let me look . Yes , it says it's a pet-friendly building . ",
          " That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ? ",
          " It says it's located in the suburbs . ",
          "Well , this apartment is really a must-see . Will you come with me to look at it this weekend ? ",
          " Sure . And if you rent it , maybe I can help you find a roommate too . ",
          " Great ! Do you know someone else who is also looking for an apartment ? ",
          " Yes , my friend Steve . I'll introduce you . ",
          "It's located in the suburbs ? Well even though that sounds like a steal , I really want something downtown . ",
          " OK . Well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive . ",
          " I know , that's my problem . What do you think I should do ? ",
          " Well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate . ",
          " Oh , great idea ! ",
          "Well , what about this two-bedroom apartment ? The listing says it's right in the heart of the city , just steps from the metro . ",
          " Wow , that would be very convenient . How much is the rent ? ",
          " It says it's $ 1600 . But if you share it with another person , that's only $ 800 per month . ",
          " That definitely sounds like a steal . I think that is a very trendy neighborhood as well . ",
          " That's true . I know that there are lots of popular restaurants and coffee shops around there . ",
          "I'm calling to ask about your apartment advertised . ",
          " Yes , we've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . And they are all newly renovated . ",
          " That sounds fantastic ! But I am looking for something closer to the downtown , as I spend most of my time at the office . ",
          " No problem . We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square . It's perfect for people busy with office work . It is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details . ",
          " I'm sure it is wonderful , but I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost . ",
          " Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find the right apartment there . ",
          " Great ! I'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . Could you tell me the detailed address ? ",
          " Of course . It's just at 19 Lingual Road . You can phone me again if you cann't find the right place . ",
          " Ok . Thank you . ",

          " Yes . Natural pearls or cultured pearls ? We have both kinds . ",
          " I wonder which looks more lustrous . ",
          " Well , natural pearls are of higher value , but the cultured pearls have equal lustre and are just as beautiful . ",
          " Oh , I see . I think I prefer a natural one . ",
          "Do you take in students ? I've been told you might have a vacant room . ",
          " Yes . If you don't mind sharing room with someone else , there's one available . ",
          " How much are you asking ? ",
          " 800 Yuan a month . ",
          " Could I have a look at it , please ? ",
          " Sorry , but I'm on my way out now . Could you come back in an hour ? ",
          "I'd like to buy one of these refrigerators . Do I have to pay in cash ? ",
          " No , we have an easy-payment plan . One-third down , and the balance in six months . ",
          " Fine . Will you work out the details , please ? ",
          " Certainly . Would you sit here please ? I'll call our credit manager . ",
          " Thank you . ",
          " It's just a formality , but for hire purchase we usually require references . ",

          " Certainly . A simple letter from your bank would be quite satisfactory . ",
          "When can I see the one-bedroom apartment ? ",

          " Would you mind waiting ? I'm on the telephone . ",

          " No , not for a few months . ",

          "Let's see . I had the salmon starter which was Â£ 5.90 and my Pizza was Â£ 8.25 . ",
          " I had the soup and bruschetta which all together is Â£ 4.50 and my trout for the main course was Â£ 12 . ",
          " So that's Â£ 14.15 for me and Â£ 16.50 for you . ",
          " Yes and shall we go fifty-fifty for the wine ? ",
          " Yes , so that's an extra Â£ 6 for both of us . ",
          " So now your bill comes to Â£ 20.15 and I need to pay Â£ 22.50 . ",
          " And I had a dessert - that's another Â£ 3.50 . And you had coffee which is Â£ 2 . ",
          " And is that all ? ",
          " Yes , this is everything on the list . ",
          " So now my bill is Â£ 24.50 and yours come to Â£ 23.65 . Is that correct ? ",
          " Yes , that's exactly it . How much tip shall we give the waiter ? ",
          " I think Â£ 5 would be good . ",
          "Good evening . ",
          " Good evening . We've a reservation for a table for four . My name is Tim . ",
          " Let me check the list . Yes , we do have a reservation under Mr . Tim . ",
          " But there is a change in the number of people . There are seven of us . Three of my friends are coming soon . ",
          " It doesn't matter . Follow me , please . What do you think of the table in the center of the dining room ? ",
          " Well , it's a window table that we've booked . ",
          " I'm sorry , but you see , all the tables by the window are small , with up to 4 seats . ",
          " Oh , I see . We'll have to make up with the center one . ",
          " Thank you for your understanding , Mr . Tim . ",
          " If a Mr . Wu comes to look for me , just take him here . ",
          " Yes , I will . ",
          "I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking . ",
          " We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments . ",
          " I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house . ",
          " We need to find a good realtor . ",
          " Not necessary . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . ",
          " What do you mean ? ",
          " Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . ",
          " But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles . ",
          " Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them . ",
          " I still think we should have a realtor . We're new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has any problems . ",
          " Of course we need a house inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . As for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us . ",
          " So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? ",
          " It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . ",
          " And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? ",
          " Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . ",
          " Why ? ",
          " That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . ",
          " Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . ",
          " It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . ",
          " I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . ",
          " All right . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drugstore . ",
          "Where to , madam ? ",
          " Grand Central Station , please . I want to catch a 6 p . m . train . ",
          " I think you'll make it if we don't get stuck in a traffic jam . ",
          " Here is the Grand Central Station . ",
          " Thank you . How much is the fare ? ",
          " The meter reads 9.15 dollars . ",
          " Here you are . Keep the change . ",
          " Thank you . ",
          "Good evening , sir . Welcome to our restaurant . ",
          " Thank you . ",
          " Do you have a reservation ? ",
          " Yes , I do . ",
          " May I have your name , please ? ",
          " Yes , it's Mr . Brown . ",
          " Mr . Brown . We were expecting you . This way , please . Will this table be fine ? ",
          " Oh , this is just fine . ",
          " Please take a seat . ",
          " Thank you . ",
          " Here is the menu . ",
          "Would you like to have a piece of cake ? ",
          " No , thank you . I'm on a diet . ",
          " Why ? You're not fat . ",
          " I'm considering entering for the beauty contest this summer , so I must have a slender figure . ",
          " Women of all shapes would be beautiful if they are self-confident . ",
          " I'm afraid the judges do not think so . All the beauty contests are for slim girls only . ",
          " Well . There's a beauty contest in Thailand just for fat beauties . ",
          " How much do they weigh ? ",
          " All the beauties who entered the contest were over 80kg . ",
          " But I'm not fat enough to enter that contest . ",
          "Excuse me . Could you tell me the way to the Star Hotel ? ",
          " Yes . Go down the main road . You can't miss it . ",
          " How long will it take me to get there ? ",
          " It's only about a five-minute walk . ",
          " Thank you very much . ",
          " You're welcome . ",
          "Where to , sir . ",
          " To this place , please . ",
          " Star Hotel . OK . ",
          " How long does it take to get to the hotel ? ",
          " About 20 minutes . ",
          " Here's the hotel . ",
          " How much is the fare ? ",
          " That's 10 dollars . ",
          "Good morning , madam . I think I'm lost here . The place I want to go to is a hotel called the Hilton . ",
          " Do you know in which area ? ",
          " No , I am sorry I have no idea . I am a stranger here . ",
          " I see . Well , do you know anything near the hotel ? ",
          " Oh , yes . My friend told me the hotel was near the Central Railway Station . ",
          " Then you'll have to take a bus and get off at the Central Railway Station . ",
          " Can you show me where the Central Railway Station is on this map ? ",
          " OK . ",
          "Hello , are you interested in this Honda ? ",
          " Hi , I am just looking . ",
          " It's a good car . ",
          " What year is it ? ",
          " 1999 . ",
          " How about the mileage ? ",
          " 6,000 miles , all highway mileage . ",
          " What do you mean 7B ",
          " Highway miles are not as bad as local miles . They do not hurt car as much . ",
          " Oh , why such a high mileage ? ",
          " The owner was commuting everyday crossing the state line . ",
          " Okay . Does this car have a warranty ? ",
          " One month . ",
          " How do I make sure I am not buying a junk ? ",
          " You'll check it out anyway you want . You can take it to a garage . ",
          " How much is it ? ",
          " $ 5,900 . ",
          " I'll have to think about it . ",
          " Leave your phone number , and I will give you a call if the price gets reduced . ",
          " Okay . ",
          "What else should we do now after the floors are done and after the furniture is in ? ",
          " We need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings . ",
          " I'm the painter . You can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains . That will probably be pretty expensive too . Having good curtains made isn't cheap . ",
          " You mean we can't just buy curtains already made ? ",
          " Absolutely not . The windows must be measured , and then the curtains need to be made professionally . So that will take a while . Maybe a month or so . ",
          " While the curtains are being made , I can start having people look at the kitchen . I can't stand that old kitchen . I won't be able to cook there . I don't want to use that electric stove . ",
          " We need to find an interior decorating company to redecorate the kitchen . I believe in Portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation . I will look in the Yellow Pages . I'd like a kitchen mostly in ivory and light green . ",
          " I agree . The colors must be soft and pleasant . You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners . ",
          " Me ? Cook our dinners ? Hah ! You will be cooking , dear . You will cook . ",
          " No , I don't think so . I'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room . ",
          " Well , I suppose we'll have to hire a cook then . So you won't be able to afford any clothes next year . ",
          " And you'll have to sell your motorcycle . And your cameras . Right ? ",
          " Maybe I'll cook once or twice a week . How is that ? ",
          " Four times might be enough . Not once or twice . ",
          "Hi , Mike . I am going to move on the first of next month . ",
          " Congratulations ! So , have you started planning your move ? ",
          " Yes , I am trying to find good movers now . Do you know any ? ",
          " Not really . ",
          " What did you do for your last move ? ",
          " Since I did not have much staff , I asked my cousin to help me out . ",
          " Oh . that's very nice of him . ",
          " Yeah , it was . But I still have some information that I collected last time , and if you want , I will give it to you . ",
          " Yes , please . ",
          "Miss , may I help you ? ",
          " Yes , I just wondered why the price between the ninth and tenth floor is so different . ",
          " It's because of the view . ",
          " Oh ! I see . Can you show me the location of Block I ? ",
          " Sure . Please take a look at the model of the building . Nice Garden has a total of two blocks which are labeled Block I and Block II . Block I has a total of thirty-eighth floors . The thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth are penthouses . There are four units in one floor . The sizes of the units are one thousand square feet and one thousand and five hundred square feet . The size with one thousand square feet has three bedrooms and the biggest size has four bedrooms . ",
          " How many elevators are there ? ",
          " There are three elevators between one hundred and forty-eight units . ",
          " How about the car-park space ? ",
          " There are a total of one hundred and sixty parking spaces on the second and third floor , in which twelve are for visitors and the rest are for residents . ",
          " Any other facilities ? ",
          " Sure , on the fourth floor is a recreation quarter . There are two swimming pools . One is Olympic standard size and the other one is for children . Also , there is a gymnasium for resident members only . ",
          " What is the completion date ? ",
          " The completion date will be July 1st 2007 . ",
          " How about the price and the bank mortgage ? ",
          " Please check up the price list . The average unit price is five million Hong Kong dollars . There are eight different banks that will provide a seventy percent mortgage loan . Also , the developer will offer another ten percent mortgage to purchasers . ",
          " How many payment methods are there ? ",
          " It's all written on the brochure price list . I believe there will be one right for you . Please hurry up because almost half of units have already gone . ",
          " Thank you . I think I have to talk to the bank representatives . Thank you for your help . ",
          " You're welcome . ",
          "You know , I'm a pretty laid-back person . I don't like to have lots of arguments or worry about lots of things . For example , I like to keep the apartment clean too , but if it gets a little dirty once in a while , that's not a big deal . ",
          " I totally agree . I really like my lifestyle to be drama-free , and I don't want to argue about cleaning the apartment . My last roommate was a drama queen . Every time I forgot to take my shoes off , she got really mad and made a big deal out of it . ",
          " Yeah , I really don't want a lot of drama in the apartment . It's important that we don't get on each other's nerves . ",
          " That's right . We should try to be laid back and not do lots of things to bother one another . ",
          "Excuse me , could you tell me which bus I should take to go to the railway station ? ",
          " I think you'd better take the No . 16 bus . It can take you right there . ",
          " How often dose this bus go there ? ",
          " Every fifteen minutes . ",
          " I really can't wait that long . Are there any other buses that can take me there ? ",
          " The No . 2 bus also goes to the railway station . You may take it . ",
          " Where can I find the bus ? ",
          " The bus stop is not far from here . Go straight on and you can easily find it . ",
          " Thanks a lot . ",
          " You are welcome . ",
          "Good morning , madam . What can I do for you ? ! ",
          " I'd like a coffee please . ",
          " Certainly , madam . What kind of coffee would you like ? ",
          " What have you got ? ",
          " Well , we have espresso , cappuccino , latte , skinny latte and Americano . ",
          " Goodness me ! So many choices ! I think I'll have a cappuccino please . ",
          " Here you are . You'll find the sugar just over there . ",
          "Hi Steve , it's nice to meet you . I hear that you're looking for an apartment , and I just rented a two-bedroom downtown . I'm looking for a compatible roommate . ",
          " Great , I'm looking for a place right in that area . Your apartment sounds ideal . ",
          " Alright . So tell me , how would you describe yourself ? ",
          " I'm pretty social and outgoing , and I like making new friends . But I'm not a party animal , and I like to keep the apartment clean . ",
          " I'm like that too . I like to invite friends over sometimes , but I don't want to have lots of crazy parties at the apartment . ",
          "What is your favorite coffee ? ",
          " Irish coffee is my favorite . But I'm not particular on it . ",
          " All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? ",
          " Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . ",
          " I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient . ",
          " Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world . ",
          " I agree . I heard that in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ? ",
          " Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee . ",
          " No , we don't , especially the elder people . But more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays . ",
          " I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in China now . ",
          "Excuse me , is this where I can catch a bus to the museum ? ",
          " Yes , you're at the right stop . ",
          " Thank you . ",
          " Are you new here ? ",
          " Yes . ",
          " Have you got small change ? They require exact fare . ",
          " Yes , I've got some coins . How much is the fare ? ",
          " One yuan . When you get on the front of the bus , just drop your money into the box . ",
          " I see . How often does this bus run at this time of day ? ",
          " It runs every ten minutes . Oh , here comes the bus . ",
          "May I know where you are going ? ",
          " Yes . I want to go to Beijing Hotel . ",
          " I'm sorry . You are going in the wrong direction . ",
          " Oh no ! What shall I do ? ",
          " Don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass . The bus stop is right there . ",
          " Thank you very much . ",
          " My pleasure . ",
          "Here we are on the train . ",
          " Yes , we are travelling at rush hours . It could be very crowded in the morning and after 6 o'clock in the afternoon . ",
          " I hear many people have cars . ",
          " Yes , almost all the families have their own cars . ",
          " Why don't they drive ? Isn't a car more convenient than the subway ? ",
          " Well , it is hard to find a parking place in the city . Besides , parking is quite expensive in the downtown . ",
          " I see . ",
          "Good coming , sir . ",
          " Good morning . ",
          " Would you mind moving to the middle of the bus ? ",
          " Of course not . But I don't know when to get off . ",
          " Where are you going ? ",
          " I'm going to Wangfujing . ",
          " Don't worry . I'll let you know when we get there . ",
          " Thank you very much . ",
          "How much is the fare ? ",
          " Three yuan . ",
          " Could you tell me how to use it ? ",
          " You put it in the slot at the turnstile and then push the turnstile to get into the platform . ",
          " Oh , I see . By the way , how can I get out of the platform after I get off the train ? ",
          " That's very easy . The exit is always open . ",
          " Thank you for your help . ",
          " My pleasure . ",
          "May I try on this pair of shoes ? ",
          " Of course . What is your size ? ",
          " I think it's 35 . ",
          " OK . I'll get it for you . ",
          " Hmm , I don't feel very comfortable . ",
          " Try this one , please . This is made of real leather and is very soft . How is it ? ",
          " This is just right for me . I'll take this one . ",
          "Can I see some men's watches ? ",
          " Of course . How about this one ? ",
          " What functions does this watch have ? ",
          " It's a luminous watch with a time-reminder function . ",
          " Is it waterproof ? ",
          " Yes , and it comes with a worldwide guarantee . ",
          " I'll take it . Please set the watch for me . ",
          "Let's go to the cinema by bus . ",
          " Better take the subway . It's far quicker and more convenient . ",
          " OK , it will be a new experience for me . ",
          " We have a rather comprehensive subway system here . You can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway , especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy . ",
          " Where do we pay the fare ? ",
          " Just give the man sitting there three yuan and he'll give you a ticket . ",
          " Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ? ",
          " No , you don't have to . Here comes the train . Be careful ! Subway doors open and close automatically . ",
          "May I help you , sir ? ",
          " I'd like to buy a shirt . ",
          " What color do you want ? ",
          " I prefer the blue one . ",
          " What size are you ? ",
          " I'm not sure . Could you measure me , please ? ",
          " No problem . I think 40 will be fine for you . ",
          " Can I try it on ? ",
          " Of course . The fitting room is this way , please . ",
          "Would you please show me the necklace in the window ? ",
          " Is this the one you want ? ",
          " No , the one next to it . ",
          " Here you are . ",
          " Thanks . What kind of stone is this ? ",
          " It's a ruby . It is from South Africa . Would you like to try it on ? ",
          " Yes , please . How much is it ? ",
          " It costs $ 200 . ",
          " It looks good . OK . I'll take it . ",
          "Let's have a look at the map first . ",
          " All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here . ",
          " Let's buy some tickets . ",
          " The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train ",
          " Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ? ",
          " No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them . ",
          "What would you have ? ",
          " I'll try Chinese wine . ",
          " What about this dry red ? It's good indeed , it never goes to the head . ",
          " OK . Give me one , please . ",
          " Here it is . ",
          " Thank you . ",
          " I'm always at your service . ",
          "May I recommend you Tsingtao beer ? ",
          " Tsingtao beer ? ",
          " Yes , sir . It's one of the best beers in China . ",
          " Really ? ",
          " Yes . The beer is brewed by using carefully selected malts , rice , hops and natural water from the Lao Mountain . ",
          " How about its taste ? ",
          " Fine , sir . ",
          " That sounds great . Two Tsingtao beers , please . ",
          " Tin or bottle ? ",
          " Tin , please . ",
          " Would you like it on the rocks , sir ? ",
          " No , thank you . ",
          " You're welcome . ",
          "Welcome ! ",
          " Would you give me a bottle of beer , please ? ",
          " With ice , sir ? ",
          " No , ice will spoil the taste . ",
          " Anything else , sir ? ",
          " Yes . Something non-alcoholic , please . ",
          " Fruit juice , milk or mineral water ? ",
          " A glass of juice please . ",
          " Coming up immediately . ",
          "I'd like to reserve a table for two , please . ",
          " For what time , sir ? ",
          " Around 8: 30 p . m . ",
          " May I have your name please , sir ? ",
          " Yes , Anthony Fox . ",
          " Mr . Fox , we'll hold the table for you for ten minutes . Please be sure to arrive before 8: 40 . ",
          "Are you ready to order now , sir ? ",
          " Yes , I'll have a steak , please . ",
          " How would you like the steak , rare , medium , or well-done ? ",
          " Rare , please . ",
          " Would you like something to drink ? ",
          " Coffee , please . ",
          "Two number 3s , please . ",
          " All right . What would you like to drink ? ",
          " Diet Coke . ",
          " Regular or large ? ",
          " Regular , please . ",
          " OK . Anything else ? ",
          " No , thanks . ",
          " For here or to go ? ",

          " Master card . Here you go . ",
          " Wait a moment , please . ",
          "Good afternoon , sir . Can I help you ? ",
          " I'd like a beef-burger , a French fries and a milk shake , please . ",
          " What flavor would you prefer , sir ? ",
          " I'm not quite sure . What do you have ? ",
          " We have strawberry , chocolate , vanilla and banana . ",
          " Very well , I'll try the banana flavor . ",
          " Anything else , sir ? ",
          " No , thanks . That will be all . ",
          "I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs . ",
          " Alright , sir . You are making a good choice . Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord . ",
          " What does it come with standard ? ",
          " On all our new cars , the standards include ",
          " Cruise control ? I don't like that . ",
          " Why not , sir ? ",
          " I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ? ",
          " Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control . But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident . ",
          " I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either . ",
          " You know , sir , you don't have to use it . You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on . ",
          " I suppose . And What about the sunroof ? Is that standard ? ",
          " No , the sunroof is optional , sir . ",
          " I see . ",
          "For me , now an important question to buy an Accord is the time when I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon . ",
          " Well , I can say that the new models will be here in August . If you order one now , we will have it for you in August . ",
          " That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ? ",
          " We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver . These are the standard colors . Of course you could specially order from various other colors too . ",
          " My brother has last year's Accord . And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord . ",
          " I know the color you mean . Is this it , sir ? ",
          " Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ? ",
          " Yes , you can . That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available . ",
          " Well , I think I want to order the new Accord then . It looks like an excellent car . ",
          " You have made a good choice , sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines , very reliable . ",
          " Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else . The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk . ",
          " Alright , sir . I will get the paperwork ready for you . Just a moment . ",
          "Would you please recommend some Chinese wine ? ",
          " Would you like to have a taste of Moutan ? ",
          " That's great ! What comes along with Moutan ? ",
          " Yes , you con order some typical Chinese dishes . For example , Roast Beijing Duck . ",
          " It sounds good . ",
          " Yes , it is the best of our hotel . ",
          " Really ? Let me have a try . ",
          " Thank you . Just a moment , please . ",
          "Hello , how are you ? I am Jack . ",
          " Hello , I am Amy . ",
          " What brings you here ? ",
          " I saw that your Corollas are on sale . ",
          " Yes , it is really a good deal . $ 1,000 discount . I've never seen a sale as good as this one . ",
          " Tell me about Corollas . ",
          " Sure . It has 1.8 liter engine . This one comes with all power options , air condition , CD player , full size spare tire , automatic transmission and ABC . The window price is $ 17,000 , and I can give You for $ 16.000 . ",
          " Sounds good . How about $ 15 , 000 ? ",
          " You must be kidding ! You cannot get that price anywhere . ",
          " I am serious . $ 15,000 . ",
          " Can you put down a $ 2,000 deposit , and I'll talk to my manager , see what we can do . ",
          " No . Just talk to your manager and let me know . ",
          " Okay , I'll be right back ... Congratulations ! The manager approved the final price $ 15,000 . ",
          " The price is fine if you give me free security system and free carpet mats . ",
          " You are really tough . You got a deal . ",
          " Thanks ! ",
          "Hi ! Do you want a fill-up ? ",
          " Yes , please . ",
          " Which type of gas do you want ? Regular , Super , or Premium Unleaded ? ",
          " What's the price difference ? ",
          " Regular is $ 1.15 , Super is $ 1.25 and Premium is $ 1.39 . ",
          " Just fill it up with Regular , Unleaded , please . ",
          " Do you want me to check the tires and the fluids ? ",
          " Yes , I would . Thanks a lot . ",
          "We'd like some local-flavored pastry . Can you recommend some ? ",
          " How about some Zongzi ? ",
          " What is that ? ",
          " Well , it's a pyramid-shaped dumpling made from glutinous rice wrapped in reed leaves . ",
          " That sounds appealing . OK , we will have that . ",
          " Do you want some stuffed bun ? It's delicious , too . ",
          " OK . We will try some . ",
          " Anything else ? ",
          " No , it's enough . ",
          " OK . Wait for a moment , please . I'll be back in a moment with the dishes . ",
          " OK . Thank you . ",
          "May I take your order ? ",
          " We'd like this course for two , please . ",
          " I'm afraid this course is for four persons . ",
          " Well , can't you make it for two only ? ",
          " I'm afraid not , sir . ",
          " I see . Well , what do you recommend then ? ",
          " I would recommend a soup with two or three small dishes . ",
          " Right , we'll have these three . ",
          " Would you like rice with your meal ? ",
          " No , thanks . ",
          " Thank you , sir . Just a moment , please . ",
          "Are you ready to order now , sir ? ",
          " Yes . ",
          " Would you like an appetizer ? ",
          " Yes . I'd like a crab cocktail . ",
          " Would you like some soup first ? ",
          " Very well . ",
          " What kind of soup would you like ? ",
          " I want egg soup . ",
          " Have you decided on anything ? ",
          " I'd like to have some meat . ",
          " How about stewed-fried steamed pork ? ",
          " No , thank you . ",
          " Are you interested in today's special ? ",

          " I'd like to have prawn cocktail , and tomato soup for the main course , I'd like steak with onion , with some black coffee afterwards . ",
          " Sorry , tomato soup is not being served today , but we have egg soup , it's very delicious . Why don't you try it today ? ",
          " It sounds good . I'll try it . ",
          " Would you like to have a drink ? ",
          " Well , I'll have a glass of mineral water . ",
          " Anything else ? ",
          " No , thank you . I think it's enough for dinner . ",
          " OK . I'll be back soon . ",
          "Is there a car park near the supermarket ? ",
          " Yes , there is an underground car park near the supermarket . ",
          " I see . Thanks . ",
          "Hello , can I help you ? ",
          " Yes , my engine warning light is on . ",
          " How long has it been on for ? ",
          " Just since today . ",
          " You can still drive , without problems . ",
          " It runs fine . ",
          " Let's check it out . There'll be a $ 45 charge to check it over . If you fix it with us , we'll include the $ 45 into your repair . ",
          " Okay . ",
          " Please write down your address and phone number , and sign here . ",
          " Okay . ",
          " It'll be about an hour . Are you going to wait ? ",
          " No , you can give a call when you have done checking . ",
          " No problem . ",
          "Can I help you ? ",
          " Yes , my brakes are not working well . ",
          " What's wrong with them ? ",
          " I hear a noise and feel vibrations when step on the brake . ",
          " The front brake ? ",
          " I think so . ",
          " What kind of car is it ? ",
          " Toyota Corolla 2002 . ",
          " Write down your name and address , give me the key , and I will check it out . ",
          " Do you charge for checking it out ? ",
          " No . ",

          " About half an hour . ",
          " I'll wait . ",
          "May I have your order , please ? ",
          " Yes , I'd like to have a share of steak . ",
          " OK . How do you like your steak , do you like it rare , medium or well done ? ",
          " I like it well-done , please . ",
          " Anything else ? ",
          " One Whisky . ",
          " It will be ready right away . ",
          "Do you eat a lot of healthy food ? ",
          " Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind . ",
          " You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . ",
          " What's special about these things ? ",
          " Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . ",
          " Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now . ",
          "I can't believe my eyes , Bill . Are you having a salad for lunch ? No hamburger ? ",
          " Get used to it , Mary . I'm off hamburgers for good health . Most fast food is loaded with sodium . ",
          " I know . But why are you suddenly interested in lessening your salt intake ? ",
          " My doctor says I should cut back on sodium-rich foods to lower my blood pressure . ",
          " Do you have hypertension ? I would have thought you were too young . ",
          " Actually , my blood pressure isn't that high yet , but they say it increases with age . ",
          " Well , I'm glad you're starting to pay more attention to your diet . ",
          " I want to lower my risk of heart attack and stroke , too . ",

          " Thank you . Could we have the menu , please ? ",
          " Sure , here you are . ",
          "My parents are always saying I am not good enough . ",
          " Really . What do they mean ? ",
          " They say my hair is too long , my room is too dirty and I am not good enough at school . ",
          " What do you think then ? ",

          "A report says running red lights causes one thousand traffic accidents every year . ",
          " It ' s horrible . Why do drivers run a red light then ? ",
          " Maybe they know they shouldn ' t run a red light , but when they are driving they don ' t pay enough attention to traffic lights . ",
          " Talking on the cell phone while driving is very dangerous too . It increases the chance of accidents . ",
          " I know . If a policeman catches you using the cell phone while driving , you will be fined . ",

          " OK . I will follow your advice . ",
          "Steven , I am ready for breakfast . ",
          " OK . But where is my favorite coffee ? ",
          " It's in that pan there . Your boy Dean broke the silex yesterday , so I have to boil it in the pan . ",
          " It tastes like crankcase oil , but delicious . ",
          " That's good . You can make breakfast yourself if you don't like it . ",
          " What is there besides coffee ? ",
          " I warmed a couple of snails , and your eggs are in the frying pan . ",
          " Oh , my God . It's nearly eight , I have no time to have breakfast now . My watch says seven fifty . ",

          " Well , please bring me the cold beef . ",
          " OK , sir . Do you want some soups ? ",
          "What do you want to eat today ? ",
          " I feel like having some dumplings . Let's go out to eat . ",
          " No need ! I know how to make dumplings . Let's do it from scratch . Can you give me a hand in the kitchen ? I don't think I can finish everything by myself . ",
          " Of course . What do you want me to do ? ",
          " Just trim vegetables for cooking . I will cut up the meat . ",
          " I can do that . And I would like to make dumplings later . ",
          " Yeah , you are my good helper , Steven . ",
          " Absolutely . ",
          "Darling , I am back . What are you doing ? ",
          " I am washing clothes . Are you hungry now ? Wait for a moment , I'll cook dinner for you . ( Steven bends his brows ) ",
          " B , should we get a maid ? ",
          " I can do all the housework . We don't need a maid . ",
          " You have worked very hard in the office . If we can get someone to help you , you can have more rest . ",
          " We really don't need to . ",
          " You are a good wife , Julia . But you must take care of yourself . ",
          " Give me some time to think about it . ",
          "What do you think of this coffee table ? ",
          " It's nice , but it doesn't match the color of our room . ",
          " How about this one ? ",
          " Oh no , this type gets dirty very easily and it's difficult to clean . ",
          " Alright , let's look at some others . ",
          " Look , this one matches our room and it's inexpensive . ",
          " Moreover , it's easy to clean , right ? You are really lazy . ",
          "Darling , this dress is for you . I hope you like it . ",
          " Oh , very beautiful . Thank you , Steven , I like it very much . ",
          " Your birthday is coming , and I think this dress suits you . Why not try it now ? ",
          " My birthday present ? I can't help telling you that I am a happy woman , darling . I will come back soon . ( Go to her bedroom and wear the new dress , then show it to Steven . ) ",
          " It fits me exactly . How does it look like ? ",
          " It displays your slender figure , darling . ",
          " The most important thing is that you bought it for me . I am happy that you know my size and style . ",
          " Because you are my dear wife . ",
          "Excuse me , waiter , I would like to have some wine before the main course . ",
          " Have you decided what wine you would like ? ",
          " I have no idea . Maybe you can give me some advice . ",
          " I recommend you the white wine . It will wake up your appetite . ",
          " That's great , bring me a bottle of that please . ",
          "I am sorry , I have broken my wine glass , and would you please bring me another ? ",
          " Sure . I will clean the glasses for you . ",
          " Thank you . Where is the washing room ? ",
          " Walk straight and turn left . ",
          "I want to keep a pet , but I don't know which one to buy ? ",
          " Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day . ",
          " Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then . ",
          " What about cats ? They are more independent . ",
          " Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat . ",
          " How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ? ",
          " Yeah , are they easy to look after ? ",
          " Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything . ",
          "What's the chef's specialty ? ",
          " It's fried sole . ",
          " Bring me one and besides , I would like to have a chicken cream soup . ",
          " Sure . Please wait for a moment . ",
          "Would you like to order now ? ",
          " Yes , can you recommend some steak ? ",
          " Sure . I think pepper steak is quite good . Many guests like it very much . ",
          " OK I will try it . Do you have a small portion ? I am afraid I can't finish the large one . ",
          " Yes madam . I will give you the small one . ",
          "Would you like something to drink ? ",
          " Yes , do you have a wine list ? ",
          " Here you are . ",
          " Bring us a bottle of Remy Martini and red wine . ",
          " Wait a moment . ",
          "Are you through with your meal ? ",
          " Yes , I am . Could I have the bill , please ? ",
          " Here is your bill . 150 yuan in all . ",
          " Do you accept check ? ",
          " No , I'm sorry we don't . We accept credit cards and cash . ",
          " Well , I'd like to pay by cash . ",
          " OK . ( A few minutes later ) Sorry to keep you waiting . Here is your change . ",
          " Thanks . ",
          " My pleasure . Welcome to our restaurant next time . ",
          "May I take your order ? ",
          " I would like to have shelled shrimps with cashew nuts . ",
          " Anything else ? ",
          " Strawberry cake as dessert , please . By the way , could you serve my main course without garlic and put less ginger in it . ",
          " No problem , sir . ",
          "Could you recommend something to drink ? ",
          " Well , since you have order the roast chicken . I suggest you to order the red wine to go with the main course . It can help you digest the food . ",
          " We would also like some alcohol before the main dish . ",
          " I think whiskey will be a good choice . ",
          "Waiter , please bring me some toast . ",
          " Sure . What kind of toast do you like ? ",
          " Pardon ? ",
          " We have white toast , whole wheat toast and rye toast . ",
          " I see , bring me the whole wheat toast . ",
          " Anything to drink ? ",
          " Milk , please . ",
          "Bring me some toast , please . ",
          " Would you like butter or jam on your toast or do you just want it plain ? ",
          " Spread some jam , please . ",
          " Anything to drink ? ",
          " Black coffee is fine . ",
          "Welcome , sir , what can I do for you ? ",
          " I want to buy some records . ",
          " Whose record do you want ? ",
          " Are there the records of Michael Jackson ? ",
          " His records have been sold out . The new copies will be available next week . ",
          " Oh . it's too late . Maybe I should go to other video stores to have a look . ",
          "What would you like to order , sir ? ",
          " I'd like to try some Chinese food . ",
          " We serve different styles of Chinese food here . But I'm not sure which one do you prefer . ",
          " I have no idea . Could you recommend some to me ? ",
          " Well . Cantonese food is rather light , Beijing food is heavy , and Sichuan food is usually hot and spicy . ",
          " Oh , I see . I'd like to have hot food . ",
          " If so , I suggest you have a taste for Sichuan food . Most Sichuan dishes are spicy and hot , but they have different tastes . ",
          " Really ? So do you have some specialties ? ",
          " Yes . Roasted Crispy Chicken and Spicy Beef are our specialties . ",
          " All right . I'll have them . ",
          "Excuse me , I ordered the well-done steak , but this one is so tough . ",
          " Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now . ",

          "May I take your order now ? ",
          " Yes , bring me a bottle of wine and filet steak . ",
          " Do you want some salad dressing ? ",
          " Yes , what kind do you have ? ",
          " We have Italian , French , thousand island and blue cheese . ",
          " I think French will be fine . ",
          "Do you take vitamin pills regularly ? ",
          " No , I don't , do you ? ",
          " Yes . Maybe you should do it too . You may not get enough vitamins from your food , you know . ",
          " But , I don't believe in taking pills to get enough vitamins . ",
          " How's that . ",
          " Because it's better , easier and cheaper to get them from the food we eat . ",
          "What kind of breakfast do you want ? ",
          " Is there any difference ? ",
          " Yes , a continental one contains eggs , bacon , toast and juice . American one is the same as a continental one except the egg . ",
          " I think I would like the former one . ",
          "What are you going to take ? ",
          " Roast pork chops with a bottle of red wine , please . Is soup served here ? ",

          " Today is my wife's birthday , so I want to buy a bouquet for her . ",
          " What kind of flowers do you want ? ",
          " I have no idea . ",
          " How about rose ? It's the most suitable one for lovers . ",
          " But rose is too common . ",
          " Well , what about violet ? It means the eternal beauty . ",
          " It looks good . Pack me a bouquet of violet , please . ",
          "May I order , please ? ",
          " Of course . ",
          " I would like sirloin steak and tomato salad . ",
          " Do you take dressing on your salad ? ",
          " Yes , blue Cheese please . ",
          "How do you like the food ? ",
          " It tastes really great . Did you cook it ? ",
          " Yes . I made it this afternoon . Would you like some more ? ",

          " What kind is it ? ",
          " Tomato and rice . Have you had that before ? ",
          " No . This is my first time . How does it taste ? ",
          " It's good , try it . What do you think ? ",
          " Wow . It is good . Did you make that also ? ",
          " Yes . ",
          " You're a really good cook . ",
          " Thanks , next time I'll make chicken soup for us . ",
          " That sounds good . Did you study cooking in school ? ",
          " No , I learned by myself . I have a good cook book that I read when I have time . ",
          "Tom , how do you think of second-hand goods ? ",
          " Why did you ask that ? Do you want to buy the used goods ? ",
          " I'm considering buying a second-hand computer for I'm short of money now . ",
          " You know the car I'm driving , which is still in good condition though it is second-hand . And it only cost me 300 dollars . It was so cheap . ",
          " But do you really mean that the second - hand goods are just as good as the new ones ? ",
          " It depends . So you must be careful buying second-hand goods . ",
          "Is there anything I can do for you ? ",
          " Excuse me , can I change my order ? I am afraid I don't have so much time to enjoy my dinner . ",
          " I am sorry , sir . Your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can't change it . ",
          " That's all right . ",

          " I would like to have the coffee rum pies . ",
          "What would you want , coffee or tea ? ",
          " Bring me a cup of coffee , please . ",
          " How do you like it ? ",
          " I'd prefer a black one . ",
          "And anything to drink ? ",
          " Yes , a red wine and a cup of coffee . ",
          " How do you like your coffee ? ",
          " With milk but without sugar , please . ",
          " Then how about the wine ? Is white wine OK ? ",
          " Yes , please . ",
          "I like Chinese food . ",
          " I like Chinese food , too . I like dumplings best . ",
          " At school , we sometimes have Chinese food for lunch . ",
          " That's good . We eat Chinese food only at the Chinese restaurant . ",

          " Yes , I like it , because it's convenient . ",
          " Last week , I tried to buy a new cellphone online , but I didn't know how to pay for it . ",
          " First , you should open an account at the online bank . After that , you can buy anything you want online . ",

          "Excuse me , waiter . I have just dropped the spoon onto the ground . Would you please bring me another one ? ",
          " Sure . Wait for a moment . Here you are . ",
          " Thank you . We'd like to have some dessert . ",
          " Here is the menu . ",

          " I am sorry , sir , it's for 4 persons to have . I think it's too large for you . ",
          " Would you please make it for a single person ? ",
          " Sorry , sir . We have never done that before . ",
          "I want to have a continental breakfast . ",
          " Here is the coffee , toast and bacon . Do you like fried eggs or poached ones ? ",
          " Neither , can I have them scrambled ? ",
          " Of course . They will be ready in a few minutes . ",

          " Perhaps you would like some sole . Many guests like it very much . ",
          " OK , we will try it . ",
          " Any drinks ? ",
          " Two bottles of white wine , please . ",

          " Our fruit is very fresh today . Do you want some ? ",
          " How much are the lemons ? ",
          " Three for ten cents . ",
          " Give me a dozen lemons . ",

          " Twenty eight dollars . ",
          "Are you being served , sir ? ",
          " I'd like to buy a tapestry to decorate my new room . ",
          " Artistic tapestry is the highest expression form of the rug weaving art . How about these ones ? ",
          " These are beautiful ! Is this the marvelous landscape in Guiling ? ",
          " Yes , sir . ",
          " How fine the needlework is ! What's the price ? ",
          " Ninety dollars . ",
          " It's too expensive . ",
          " But considering the fine craftsmanship it is worth much more . ",
          " You're right . Would you please show me some embroidery ? I also want to buy some embroidered tablecloths to match the tapestry . ",
          " Please wait a minute , sir . ",
          "Waiter , I would like to order now . ",
          " Sure . What do you want to have today ? ",
          " Cream soup and steak , please . ",
          " How do you like your steak ? ",
          " Excuse me , what does that mean ? ",
          " Well , there are several kinds of steaks . For example , you can have your steaks medium-rare , medium-well or well-done . ",
          " Thanks for your explanation , I would like it well-done . ",
          "You look so excited . What happened ? ",
          " You are not going to believe this . Do you remember the dress we saw at Mayors that was so beautiful and expensive ? I got it today at half price . ",
          " So they have started the year end sale earlier this year . ",
          " How can you stay so calm ? Aren't you going to take a look to see if there is anything for you ? ",
          " I guess I'll wait a few more days . There maybe even bigger discount then . ",
          " But there won't be anything good left . ",
          "Wow , what a cool car ! The styling of this car really appeals to me . ",
          " Yes , this is a very popular car . ",
          " I want to buy it . How much does this car cost ? ",
          " The car is beautiful , isn't it ? Come on inside and we'll discuss the price . ",
          " You can tell me here . I just want to know the price . ",
          " 50000 yuan ' What a deal ! That will , of course , include tax , licence , and registration fee . ",
          " I appreciate your help , but I think I'll look around a bit . ",
          " Then what price would be fair to you ? ",
          " I think that 30000 yuan would be fair for this car . ",
          " I can see that you are a smart buyer . Forty thousand is my best price . ",
          " Can't you make it cheaper ? I still can't afford the car . ",
          " 38000yuan is my final offer . ",
          " Hum ... OK . I will take it . ",
          "Welcome , sir . What can I do for you ? ",
          " May I have a look at that china tea set ? It is extremely beautiful . ",
          " You've made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual . It was made in Jingdezhen . ",
          " Jingdezhen ? Oh , I know it . Isn't it called the capital of porcelain ? ",
          " Yes , sir . ",
          " Oh , it must be very precious . Is it breakable ? ",
          " No , if you take some care when you use them . ",
          " How much is it ? ",
          " Two thousand . ",
          " Oh , it is beyond my purse . ",
          "Are you ready to order , sir ? ",
          " Yes , I would like a roast duck and my friend wants steaks . ",
          " How do you like your steaks ? ",
          " I'd like it medium-well . ",
          " OK , sir , wait a minute . ",
          "What do you like for dessert ? ",
          " Do you have trifles ? ",
          " Yes . ",
          " Please bring me some trifles and apple pies . ",
          " OK . I will bring it for you . ",
          "Good morning , sir . Could I be of any service to you ? ",
          " Have you got any Chinese paintings ? ",
          " Yes , we have landscape paintings , figure paintings and flower-and-bird paintings . ",
          " I'd like a flower-and-bird painting . ",
          " Good . How about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? It was painted by a famous Chinese painter in King Dynasty . ",
          " Oh , they look just like live cranes . I like this picture very much . How much is it ? ",
          " One thousand dollars . ",
          " It's a lot of money . But the picture is excellent , I'll take it . ",
          "You ran the stop sign . May I see your driver's licence , please ? ",
          " Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't see the stop sign at the corner . I didn't mean it . ",
          " That doesn't justify your violation . May I see your licence , please ? ",
          " Oh , sorry , I don't have it on me . Honestly , I forgot it at the house . But I have the insurance policy with me . Here it is . ",
          " Well , sir , your insurance looks good , but I still have to write you a ticket . ",
          " I understand , officer . I guess it's just not my day today . I will accept the fine . ",
          "Do you see that small white car over there ? It ' s Tom ' s new car . ",
          " Oh , my God . It ' s beautiful . But it looks expensive . ",
          " It is very expensive . Tom ' s father paid for it . ",
          " I want to have a car like that . But I am not rich . And I don ' t have a rich daddy . ",
          " They are By new models now , they are not very expensive . Maybe you should look for one . ",
          "Excuse me , I'm afraid you've parked in the wrong spot . ",
          " Oh , really ? Isn't this spot C408 ? ",
          " No , it's D408 , my parking space . I have already paid for it . ",
          " I'm sorry , I must have been confused . I had thought it's C section , but actually it's D section . I'll move my car right away . ",
          " It's no big deal . Thank you . ",
          "Hi , Bob . I heard that you had passed your driving test . Is it true ? ",
          " Yes . A few days ago I have no right to get a driving licence . But now I get it . ",
          " Is the driving test difficult ? ",
          " Yes , it can be quite tough . Many people fail to pass the test at the first time . ",
          " What does the driving test require ? ",
          " You should enroll in driving school and then take a road test and a written test . After you pass both tests , you'll get your licence . ",
          " Oh , I see . I need more practice before I take the driving test . ",
          " Don't worry about your driving test . I think you will pass the test and get the driver's licence very soon . ",
          " Hopeful ! Thank you . ",
          "Have you decided on something ? ",
          " Yes , please bring us two steaks . ",
          " Sure . Anything else ? ",
          " What vegetables come with the steaks ? ",
          " Potato chips and French dressing . ",
          "Can I help you , sir ? ",
          " Yes . Fill it up , please . ",
          " OK . What kind of gas do you want ? ",
          " I don't really know . I have just bought this new car . And it's the first time I've gotten gas for it . ",
          " We have regular , super , and premium gasoline . This is a new car , so I'd recommend premium . ",
          " Premium , please . Thanks . Please fill it up . ",
          " All right , sir . You will park at refueling 4 . ",
          " OK , thanks . ",
          " Your car's ready . ",
          " Good . How much does it come to ? ",
          " Ten gallons of premium . That's $ 18.56 , please . ",
          " OK . Here you are . ",
          " Thank you , sir . Have a nice drive ! ",
          "Everything is OK now , doctor . ",
          " That was quick work . Let me have a look at it . Yeah , everything looks fine now . Thank you very much . ",
          " You are welcome , doctor . ",
          " How much do I owe you ? ",
          " The total is 87 dollars . Here is the bill . ",
          " Really ? You worked here for just half an hour . I consider the price very high . ",
          "Have you made up your mind ? ",
          " Not yet , can you recommend me some chickens ? ",
          " We have roast chicken , grilled chicken , chicken curry and chicken chops . ",
          " Please bring me the chicken chops . ",
          "Sir , here is your curried beef . ",
          " Well . I am afraid you have made a mistake . It's not the dish I ordered . ",
          " Let me see , I am sorry . It's for table 11 . ",
          " It doesn't matter . ",
          "Waiter , we have been waiting for 20 minutes . Would you mind hurrying ? ",
          " I am sorry , sir , the fish you ordered will take a longer time because we make it with fresh fish . ",
          " That's fine . Would you please bring me some wine ? ",
          " Sure , is dry white wine OK ? ",
          " Yes . Thank you . ",
          "How do you like you dishes today ? ",
          " Not so delicious as before , but it's fine . The soup is tasty but the meat is a little tough . ",
          " I am sorry for that . We will improve the dishes next time . ",
          "Do you like the food here ? ",
          " Yes . The baked fish was out of this world . ",
          " I am glad you like it . ",
          " Can we have the bill now ? ",
          " Sure . It's $ 100 . ",
          "Steven , what are you thinking about ? ",
          " Oh , you know , tomorrow is Vicky's birthday . I am thinking what gift to give her . ",
          " That's easy . A girl at her age must like beautiful ornaments . How about a hair pin ? ",
          " It's a bad idea . Vicky has short hair . ",
          " Well , what about a brooch ? ",
          " Only old women like that . ",
          " Maybe you should ask her what she wants for her birthday . ",
          " OK . That's what I can do . ",
          "You sure are buying a lot of things online . ",
          " Yes , I ordered a camera and some personal care stuff online yesterday . They will be delivered in two weeks . ",
          " What are the advantages of buying online ? ",
          " Sometimes you can save money and you can find things that you had difficulty finding in a store . sometimes it's just convenient , like doing it late at night and sometimes it's just fun . ",
          " The idea of doing it at night is interesting . Maybe I'll try it some day . ",
          "Good afternoon , how may I help you ? ",
          " Hi , I'd like to order some flowers . ",
          " Who are they for ? ",
          " They're for my Wife . Her name is Samantha . ",
          " What kind of flowers would you like ? ",
          " I don't know . I don't know too much about flowers . Can you recommend something ? ",
          " OK . What's the reason you are sending her flowers ? ",
          " Today's her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers . ",
          " Do you know what kind of flowers she likes ? ",
          " I'm not sure . I know I should know that , but I can't remember right now . ",
          " Well , they're for your wife , so I think you should give her roses . ",
          " Roses will be fine . ",
          " What color ? ",
          " I think red would be nice . ",
          " Do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them ? ",
          " Can you deliver them , please ? ",
          " What's the address ? ",
          " 241 Main street . ",
          "Let's have lunch together today . ",
          " It's a good idea . ",
          " I want a Hamburger and ice cream . What about you ? ",
          " I don't like Hamburgers . They have no taste . ",
          " What about cheese cake or apple pie ? ",
          " Maybe I want an apple pie . ",
          "Waiter , the dish is cold to eat . Could you please heat it up for me ? ",
          " Sure . Wait a moment . ",
          " By the way , I would like some chilli oil . ",
          " OK . ",
          "Is there a sofa in the living room ? ",
          " I am afraid there isn ' t . ",
          " That ' s too bad . Is there a desk in the living room then ? ",
          " There is a desk and two chairs . ",
          " Where are the chairs ? ",
          " They are behind the door . ",
          "That dog has white long hair . It ' s lovely . ",
          " She is my dog . I like her very much . ",
          " What ' s her name ? ",
          " Her name is Fluffy . She is a sweet dog . ",
          " My dog has spots . He is very strong . ",
          " But I don ' t like big strong dogs . ",
          "May I take your order ? ",
          " What's the specialty of the house ? ",
          " The baked fish in tomato sauce is pretty good . ",
          " I like fish . Please bring me an order of that . ",
          " Do you want some dessert ? ",
          " Apple pie , please . ",
          " Single or double ? ",
          " Make it two . ",
          "Waiter , get me rag , please . I have just spilled my wine . ",
          " Let me help you . ",
          " Thank you . Please bring me some paper napkins . ",
          " Here you are . ",
          " I think I should be more careful next time . ",
          "Hello , Steven , what are you doing now ? ",
          " I am preparing a birthday party for Julia . ",
          " Can I be of any help to you ? ",
          " Of course , could you help to blow up some balloons ? ",
          " I hate balloons . ",
          " Well , would you please clean the livingroom ? You know I'm too busy . ",
          " No problem . ",
          "Steven , we are preparing a martial arts show for the New Year's party . Would you like to join us ? ",
          " I'd love to ! But I have never learned martial arts , and there is only a month left before the New Year . ",
          " That's OK . A month is enough for you to learn the basic movements . It would be great to have you with us on the show . ",
          " Sounds great ! Shall I learn the actions that Jet Li did in the movies ? ",
          " No . You know , there are many schools and styles of kung fu . What we will perform is a set of Chinese shadow boxing . ",
          " Whatever ! I'm glad to learn something of Chinese kung fu . Thanks for asking me . ",
          " Thank you for joining us ! Now let's see some pictures and know more about kung fu . ",
          " Good ! ",
          "Here is your bill . It's $ 60 . ",
          " What's this amount for ? ",
          " It's for the drinks . ",
          " I see . Can I pay by credit card ? ",
          " Sure . ",
          "You seem to be upset . What ' s eating you ? ",
          " It ' s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves ",
          " Dick ? How come ? He used to be as meek as a lamb . ",
          " Yes , he used to be . But now he ' s drifting off track . ",
          " He must have been in bad company , or he wouldn ' t be off the beans . ",
          "Professor Li , do you know where to buy art supplies ? ",
          " For what ? Are you taking up painting ? ",
          " No . I can't paint . I'm asking for my niece . She is really into it . ",
          " Oh , good . How old is your niece ? ",
          " She is eight . Actually , I'm buying a good set of art supplies for her as a birthday gift . ",
          " It's a wise thing to do . Art will do a child a world of good . ",

          " If the weather is good , I'll go to climb mountains . ",
          " Are you going with your friends ? ",
          " No , I'm going alone . ",
          " Oh , aren't you afraid ? ",
          " Of course not . For me , mountaineering is both relaxation and a hobby . ",
          " I think mountaineering is an exciting sport , but a little dangerous . ",
          " Yeah , you are right , but it's really interesting . ",
          "Waiter , please make out the bill . ",
          " OK , sir . How do you like your meal ? ",

          " What are you going to enjoy ? ",
          " I want some exciting . Which is more fun , the roller coaster or the ferris wheel ? ",
          " I like neither . ",
          " Come on . Here is for enjoying and exciting . ",
          " OK , let me think . The roller coaster looks more fun . ",
          " I like ferris wheel more . ",
          " It doesn't matter . We can go to the ferris wheel later . ",
          " OK , let's go . ",
          "Hello , I want to order an Easy-own package . What would you recommend ? ",
          " Which function do you use more , making calls or sending short messages ? ",

          " Then I recommend this package to you . You can receive all the calls free by paying just 10 yuan a month . ",
          " That's good . How can I order it ? ",

          " It looks like you're very interested in the circus . ",
          " Yes , I love to see the animal show . ",
          " I have never seen those before , but since you're so excited it should be good . ",
          " I'm sure you'll love it . ",
          " Okay , I will go and get some popcorn first . ",
          "Dad , how can we get to the zoo ? ",
          " We can take a bus there . ",

          " I think so . ",
          " Let's step in , Dad . ",
          " No , it's too crowded . ",
          " Dad . Here comes another bus . ",
          " Fine . Let's get on . Oh , no , Judy ! Get off the bus quickly ! ",
          " Why ? Dad ? ",
          " We got on the wrong bus . ",
          "There's a question I'm not sure whether it is suitable to ask . ",
          " You know that I have no secrets toward you . ",
          " When you go dinner with John , who foots the bill ? ",
          " Why asking that ? It's often the sort of Dutch treat . ",
          "Waiter , can I have the bill please ? ",
          " Wait a moment . It's $ 30 . ",
          " We'd prefer separate checks . ",
          " OK , one with the apple pie pays $ 18 and the other $ 12 . ",
          "Hello , could I make a reservation ? ",
          " Sure . At what time ? ",
          " 6 o'dock in the evening . ",
          " Let me see ... Sorry , sir . We are fully booked tonight . Would you mind making a reservation some other time ? ",
          " Do you offer mutton hot pot at noon ? ",
          " Yes , sir . ",
          " Then we will come here for lunch tomorrow . ",
          "Could I have a refund on this ? ",
          " I'm afraid you can ' t . ",
          " Then can I exchange it for something else with the same price ? ",
          " Just a moment . Let me find out . Our manager Wil be here in a minute . So will you speak to him ? ",
          " OK . I will . ",
          "Switchboard . Which extension would you like ? ",
          " Extension 1616 , please . ",
          " I'm afraid the line is busy at the moment . Just hold on , please . ",
          " Then , will you try extension 235 ? ",
          " Certainty , sir . ",
          "You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ? ",
          " Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful . ",
          " So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ? ",
          " Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities . ",
          " Do you do the same exercises every day ? ",
          " No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park . ",
          " Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ? ",
          " It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them . ",
          " Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally . ",
          "Can I help you ? ",
          " Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . ",
          " Well , you heard right . You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . We have great discounts for students . ",
          " I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . ",
          " Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend-the Power Macintosh G3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . ",
          " Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? ",
          " Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ? ",
          " History . ",
          " Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your hardware first . We have a special deal on right now . I should tell you about it , as it only goes until next Tuesday . If you buy one of these fifteen-inch color monitors with a Power Macintosh G3 , you can actually get 30 percent off the usual sale price . ",
          " Thirty percent ? ",
          " Yes . ",
          " Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? ",
          " Yes . It's an excellent system . ",
          " Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? ",
          " Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Mcintosh and Apple are the same thing . ",
          " I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . ",
          " I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . ",
          " What ? Are you serious ? ",
          " Yes . ",
          " But nobody uses Macintosh ! ",
          " That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . May I ask where you're from ? ",
          " Yes , I'm from Taiwan . ",
          " Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . ",
          " But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . ",
          " There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple . ",
          " Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . ",
          " No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university-Asian students included-most of them use Apple . ",
          " Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . ",
          " You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . ",
          "Okay . This trail looks the best . It's a little steep . But I'm sure it will be alright . ",
          " Well . You're the tour guide , I'll follow you . ",
          " ... What a stink . This place stinks like rotten eggs . ",
          " That's sulphur you can smell . The whole of Taiwan is a volcanic region . That's why Taiwan has so many hot springs . It's volcanic activity.The sulfur smoke that you can smell is coming from those fumaroles over there . ",
          " Suddenly the ' great outdoors ' isn't so appealing . Let's hike a little faster ... ",
          "What would you like for your main dish ? ",
          " Steak , please . ",
          " How would you like it ? ",
          " Medium rare , please . ",
          " Anything else , sir ? ",
          " May I have a glass of red wine , please ? ",
          " Of course . ",
          "Excuse me . Can you take me to the airport ? ",
          " Which airport , ma'am ? ",
          " Kennedy Airport . ",
          " All right , ma'am . Need any help with your luggage ? ",
          " Thank you , but I'd rather keep this case with me . ",
          "How about going swimming ? ",
          " OK . Where should we go ? ",
          " Why don't we go down to the pool ? It's not too far from here . ",
          " Fine . I'll be ready in a minute . ",
          "Hello , this is Sheila from Huawei Corp . Is that Li Lei ? ",
          " Yes , speaking . ",
          " I am glad to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow . Are you free tomorrow ? ",
          " Can you speak a little louder ? You sound very indistinct with the hissing noise . ",
          " Well , I can't hear you . ",
          "Excuse me . This bus goes downtown , doesn't it ? ",
          " Yes . Where do you want to go ? ",
          " The Workers'Stadium . ",
          " This is the right bus . ",
          " Will you let me know where to get off ? ",
          " Certainly.Four more stop after this . I'll call out the stops . ",
          " Thank you . ",
          "Anything else , sir ? ",
          " That's all for now . How much do I owe you ? ",
          " That'll be fifty-five dollars and twenty cents . ",
          " Can't you make it a little cheaper ? ",
          " Oh , no , sir . We already gave you a discount on each item . ",
          " OK . I understand . Thank you . ",
          "May I see that ivory horse ? ",
          " Of course . ",
          " It's genuine , I bet . ",
          " It's made of genuine ivory , besides , it's of exquisite workmanship . The price is marked 200 yuan . ",
          " I'll take it . ",
          "Excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the Cross Bakery building ? ",
          " The Cross Bakery building ? Oh sure . You're actually walking in the opposite direction . ",
          " Oh , you're kidding ! I thought I was heading east . ",
          " No , east is the other direction . To get to the Bakery , you need to turn around and go three blocks to Broadway . When you get to the intersection of Broadway and Elm , you hang a left . Go straight down that street for half a block and then you'll see the building on your left . ",
          " Okay , let me see if I've got that . I need to go down Elm until I hit Broadway , then I make a left and the building is on my left hand side . Is that right ? ",
          " Yeah , you've got it . Do you want me to show you the way ? ",
          " Thanks for the offer , but I think I've got it . Hopefully , I won't get lost again on my way there ! ",
          "Hello . Can I speak to Alice , please ? ",
          " Hold on , please . ",
          " Thank you . ",
          " Sorry , but she's out . ",
          " Would you tell her Tom Gray called ? ",
          " I'd be glad to . ",
          "Would you give me some fruits ? How much are these oranges ? ",
          " Seventy cents a piece . ",
          " How about this one ? ",
          " Sixty cents a piece . ",
          " Well , I'll take five of the seventy cent ones , and those grapefruits sweet ? ",
          " Sure ! They are very fresh , first of all . We sell at a bargain , and you make a wise purchase if you buy them today . Eighty cents only , a piece . ",
          " I follow you and I'll take three just for my trial . ",
          " Thank you very much and anything else ? ",
          " That's all.Thank you . ",
          "May I help you ? ",
          " Could I have a look at those pens ? ",
          " Certainly . These are thirty yuan each and these are twenty-five . ",
          " Have you got anything a bit cheaper ? ",
          " How about these ? They are nine yuan each . ",
          " No , they're not quite what I want . Sorry to trouble you . ",
          " Not at all . ",
          "Can I have my money back on this skirt ? ",
          " Anything wrong with it ? ",
          " Yes , this is defective . See ? I didn't notice this hole when I bought it . ",
          " Oh , I'm very sorry about that . You can change it for another one if you prefer . ",
          " If you have exactly the same one-same color , same design , and same size , of course . ",
          " This one is the same size and color . But the design is different . ",
          "What can I do for you ? ",
          " Do you have any blue shirts ? ",
          " Yes . What's your size ? ",
          " I'm not familiar with American size . ",
          " All right . Let me see . I think you'd wear a size 8 . This shirt is size 8 . ",
          " It's pretty . May I try it on ? ",
          " Sure . The fitting room is over there . ",
          " Thank you . ",
          "I often see some ' new age people ' show off their various skills to handle a skateboard , which makes me wonder in awe . ",
          " Annie , you also know the ' new age people ' . I think these people must have undergone much sufferings of flesh in order to ride skillfully . ",
          " Although it is easy to ride , the condition of the road surface should also be paid attention to , such as places being put together and full of gullies . If the condition permits , it is better to be equipped with helmet , eye shades , ankle shield , knee shield and elbow shield . ",
          " The skateboard does not pollute the air , either . It can be used as a tool to ride instead of walk . ",
          "Have you got any outdoor interests ? ",
          " Yes . My only recreation is skateboarding . ",
          " Oh , I know it . It is included in extreme sports . I think it's too dangerous for me . ",
          " Maybe . But it emphasizes participation and a spirit of courage , and can give one the extreme sense of cheerfulness and success . I'm getting to like the game more and more . ",
          "Do you want to buy something here ? ",
          " These shoes are great ! What is the price of this ? ",
          " This one is two hundred yuan . ",
          " That's too much ! ",
          "What do you want to do tonight ? ",
          " I don't know . What do you want to do ? ",
          " I have no idea . Do you think we're in a rut ? ",
          " What do you mean ? ",
          " Well , we do the same things every weekend . We go to the same restaurants . We see the same friends . You know what I mean ? ",
          " Yeah , I guess you're right . It's easy to get bogged down in the day to day , and forget to change things up once in a while . Let's break out and do something completely different tonight . ",
          " Okay , I'll look in the events section of the paper to see what's going on tonight . Hmm , we could go to a concert . There is a good one tonight . I bet it's not sold out . But , we'll have to drive an hour to the venue . ",
          " An hour ? That's a bit of a bummer . Let me take a peek and see what else there is . How about going dancing ? We haven't done that in a while . There's a club in Silver Lake that's supposed to be hopping on Friday nights . Eddie from work told me that they have a really good DJ and a big dance floor , and the cover charge isn't bad . ",
          " I'm not really in the mood for dancing , actually . You know what ? I just feel like staying home tonight and vegging , after all . How about you ? ",
          " Yeah , I was hoping you'd say that . It's nice to have the option to go out but I'd rather stay in . Maybe we can go out tomorrow night . ",
          " Yeah , definitely , tomorrow night . ",
          "What kind of permanent would you like to have ? ",
          " What kinds do you have ? ",
          " Oh , we have quite a regular , cold perm , straight perm , pin curl and foam . ",
          " Last time I tried a pin curl perm and a foam permanent . Set the wave a little looser than usual , please . ",
          "I think Yoga might be suitable for me . ",
          " Why ? ",
          " Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up . ",
          " But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too . ",
          " I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight . ",
          " You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit . ",
          "What are you waiting for ? Get on that bus quickly . ",
          " But where do I get a ticket ? ",
          " On the bus . The driver collects the fares . You'll have to take your luggage on board . ",
          " Oh , I wish I didn ' t have so much to carry . ",
          "Do you carry black ink ? ",
          " The ink should be next to the paper clips and thumb tacks in the stationary section , sir . ",
          " I've looked for , but I didn't see any black ink . ",
          " Then I'm afraid there's none in stock . ",
          " Well , I'll settle for blue-black . I'll also take a dozen airmail envelopes . ",
          " They come in packages of ten or twenty . ",
          " Give me a package of twenty , then . And where do I find shoelaces ? ",
          " On counter three . ",
          " Thank you . I never can find my way around this store . ",
          " I know . It took me three weeks , and I work here . ",
          "Excuse me , which one is of the highest quality here ? ",
          " This one . It is of the best quality and excellently tailored as well . You may try it on . ",
          " That is nice . But I don't quite like the collar . ",
          " The collar ? It is just the collar that is popular with young people in Shanghai . ",
          " I don't care what others wear . How much is it ? ",
          " 250 Yuan . ",
          " Really ? Too expensive . I don't think I can afford it . ",
          " But it is really worthwhile . ",
          " OK , anyway , let me have it . ",
          " Here you are . ",
          " Thank you . ",
          "Excuse me , which way is to the post office ? ",
          " The post office ? Sorry , I'm not sure . ",
          " Well , thanks anyway . ",
          "Next , please . Where to , sir ? ",
          " A one-way ticket to Chicago , please . ",
          " How many did you say , sir ? ",
          " One adult , please . ",
          " That will be six dollars . Out of ten-seven , eight , nine , ten . Thank you . ",
          "I'm interested in Chinese antiques . ",
          " We have a great variety of Chinese antiques . Besides , we have landscape painting , figure painting and flower-and-bird painting . ",
          " I'd like a flower-and-bird painting . ",
          " How about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? It was painted by a famous Chinese painter in King Dynasty . ",
          " Oh , they look just like live cranes . ",
          " And what is more , in traditional Chinese thinking , cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity . ",
          "What did you say your stop was ? ",
          " Fifth Avenue . ",
          " Oh , then you should have gotten off at the last stop . ",
          " I should have ? ",
          " But don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and walk back . It's not far . ",
          "Mary , come here . I've found the book our teacher recommended us to buy last week . ",

          " You know , it is the best seller for this year . It has had its fifth impression since its publication early this year . ",
          " How come ? I have never seen such a popular book before . ",
          " Wait a minute . I found there were two printings . The paperback books must be much cheaper . ",
          " You are right . Let's buy the cheaper one . ",

          " No , it isn't . ",

          " Oh , no . This is going in the opposite direction . ",
          " Oh , my God ! ",
          " I suggest you get off at the next stop and ask again at the station . ",
          " I will . Thank you . ",

          " May I take a bus or a taxi to get there ? ",
          " You can take No . I bus or a taxi . ",
          " Excuse me , sir . Where is the No . 1 bus stop ? ",

          " Twenty dollars and sixty cents . ",
          " What ? You're overcharging me ! ",
          " No way . Look . That's what the meter says . ",
          " Then something must be wrong with the meter . ",
          "What can I show you ? ",
          " Do you have this shirt in a small ? ",
          " Let me check . Yes , we have . ",

          "In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off . ",
          " You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord . ",
          " Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage . ",
          " A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , \" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . \" ",
          " It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of ' comfortable ' ",
          "Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot . It's so open . And just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness . ",

          " You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the coming . ",
          " No wonder people say , Even the immortals would rather be Guiliners . ",
          " ... Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky . ",
          " I didn't know you liked bird watching . ",

          "I'm planning to buy a bicycle . As you are quite a cycling enthusiast , I wish you might give me some advice . ",
          " With pleasure , chap . But before I start , I need to know what you want a bike for ? ",
          " My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . On the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends . ",
          " Cycling during weekends ? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ? ",
          " Does that make any difference ? ",
          " Can't be greater . If you ride on bumpy , hilly roads , a mountain bike is what you need . But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike . ",
          " Are they designed differently ? ",
          " A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . It's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . In contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame . You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over . ",
          "This place is great . I'm surprised there are so many things here . ",
          " Yes , but it takes a while to find things . It's not organized as carefully as a regular store . ",
          " What's the difference between an outlet and a regular store ? ",
          " Usually a clothes company will send their overstock to an outlet . The prices are very low . But you may find faulty products here too . ",
          " Faulty products ? ",
          " Yes . Sometimes the fault is very small ; if you have a needle and thread , you can fix it yourself . So it's a good deal to buy it . ",
          " Oh , that's easy for me . I think it's really a good deal . ",
          " Yes . You can save a lot of money in this way . ",
          " That's great for me . Look , children's clothes ! I'd like to buy some winter clothes for my son and daughter . ",
          " Why not buy the sweater ? It only costs 30 Yuan . ",
          " Yes , I'll take it . Are there any jeans ? Xiaohui's jeans are always dirty . I also need four pairs of slippers . ",
          " How many do you want to buy ? ",
          " I ought to make the most of it while I'm here , don't you think ? ",
          " You're right . ",
          "You're looking very well . ",
          " Thank you . I try to keep in shape . ",
          " Do you often exercise ? ",
          " Yes , as long as I can find the time . I like swimming best . ",
          " What style of swimming do you like best ? ",
          " I like the back best . I am good at freestyle stroke , but I usually use breast stroke as it keeps me from getting tired . ",
          " I think butterfly stroke is the most difficult style to learn . ",
          " I agree . I'm not good at it , either . Can you swim ? How about going for a swim this Saturday ? ",
          " Oh , no . I am quite a stone in the water and cannot swim . ",

          " No , thank you . ",
          " Why not try on this lovely pair of shorts ? I'm sure they'd look fabulous on you . ",
          " No doubt . Look , I'm just browsing . If I need your help , I'll let you know . ",
          " Take a look at this dress . Don't you think it's perfect for you , ma'am ? Uh , where are you going , ma'am ? Ma'am ? ",
          "Have you any beef today ? ",
          " Yes , we've got a very tender new shipment from the mainland . It is a weekend special . ",

          " You see . I've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite . ",
          " I'd better exercise my body too . My limbs are rusty now . ",

          "Ping-pong must be the top-ranking popular sport in China . It seems to me in every school , factory , army unit , or residential area , men and women , young and old , are swinging paddles . ",
          " You got it ! In a sense , it has become a byword for Chinese sport . ",
          " What do you think might be the source of its popularity ? ",
          " I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . All you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . Tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ... ",
          " And sometimes a substitute table can be made out of a few desks . ",
          " Put it there ! In senior high schools , we used to play on desks in the classroom , when no vacant tables were available . Likewise , the racket may take a variety of forms , too.Anything that resembles a racket , from a plank to cardboard or even a hardcover book , may be used as a racket . ",
          " Haha , these are very good inventions . All these speak the public's fondness for the sport ",
          " Yeah , the sport is affordable and accessible to every Tom , Dick and Jane in this developing country . No wonder even the state leaders are known to be keen on it . ",
          " I know President Hu Into likes playing ping-pong . ",
          " Actually , he excels in it . Chairman Mao , too , encouraged the whole nation to play ping-pong as a part of the nationwide body building campaign . ",
          " I see . There was also the famous ping pong diplomacy , wasn't there ? ",
          "How do you feel ? ",
          " I like the style but it is a little tight in the waist . ",
          " Here is the bigger size . ",
          " This one fits me well but it is too expensive , can you make it a little cheaper ? ",
          "Good evening , sir . What's your pleasure ? ",
          " Give me a shot of whisky and soda . ",
          " With or without ice , sir ? ",
          " Certainly without ice . Ice will spoil the taste . ",
          " Would you like to say ' when ' , please , sir . ( Pouring soda ) ",
          " Whoa , when . ",

          "She's a Persian . She has papers and everything . Not like a street dog . ",
          " Cats chase mice , don't they ? ",
          " And bugs . They can catch anything . ",
          " Do you have to walk a cat ? ",
          " No , they use litter boxes or go outside by themselves.Thev ' re so smart . ",
          " But then you have to change the litter box . ",
          " It's better than picking up dog poop . ",
          "Good evening , sir . What's your pleasure this evening ? Your usual ? ",
          " Yes . I'm going to stay with the same , a beer . ",
          " Certainly , a beer . Here you are , sir . ",
          " Oh , darn . Look what I've done . ( Spill the drink ) ",
          " Don't worry . I'll make you another on the house . ",
          "I'm getting so paunchy that I'm afraid I have to buy a new belt to-morrow , and I think I must go on a diet . ",
          " You are just a little bit chubby , not paunchy . ",
          " You know , I'm a compulsive overeater . I got to watch what I eat . ",
          " More physical exercise may help to keep your weight down . ",
          " You said it . ",
          "Hi . Can I help you ? ",
          " No , thanks . I ' m just looking around . ",
          " Okay . Please let me know if you need any help . ",
          " Thanks a lot . ",
          "Is this where I can catch a bus to the theater ? ",
          " Yes , but you can't get there with out a change . ",
          " Which bus do I have to change ? ",
          " You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 . ",
          " I see . Thank you . ",
          "Morning , Tom ! What are you doing over there ? Learning to dance ? ",
          " Can't you see ? I'm practicing tai chi ! ",
          " Oh , my goodness . I'm sorry . But I don't think tai chi is to be practiced like that . ",
          " I'm just a beginner . Did my poses make me the butt of jokes ? ",
          " Well , they just look a bit funny . but far from making a laughing stock out of you . ",
          " So , is there anything wrong with my strokes ? ",
          " To begin with , you should keep your neck erect upward at any time . ",
          " Like this ? ",
          " Good ! And then , the entire body . Never incline your body forward or backward . Take care to regulate the point of balance . Place it at your waist . ",
          " Did I do it right ? ",
          " No ! You should avoid sticking out your belly . Keep your hip steady . Don't swing . ",
          " What should I do with my legs then ? ",
          " Oh , yes , things are quite different with the limbs . Keep your knees bent a little . Right , they should be rich in elasticity . Move slowly when you shift your centre of gravity from one leg to another . ",
          " Fantastic ! I guess the same is true with the arms , right ? ",
          " Exactly ! Move your arms in a relaxed manner . Well . don't stretch yourfingers stiffly . Just keep them in a natural shape . ",
          "Excuse me , I'm looking for the Holiday Inn . Do you know where it is ? ",
          " Sure . It's down this street on the left . ",
          " Is it far from here ? ",
          " No , it's not far . ",
          " How far is it ? ",
          " About a mile and a half . ",
          " How long does it take to get there ? ",
          " 5 minutes or so . ",
          " Is it close to the subway station ? ",
          " Yes , it's very close . The subway station is next to the hotel . You can walk there . ",
          " Thanks a lot . ",
          "Excuse me , driver . Does this bus go to the museum ? ",
          " Yes , you get off at the square . ",
          " How long is the ride ? ",
          " Well , you will get there in about half an hour if the traffic isn't too heavy . ",
          " Thank you.How much is the fare ? ",
          " Drop 50 cents in the box , please . ",
          " Would you please let me know when we get to the stop ? I am a stranger here . ",
          " Sure . I will . ",
          "Excuse me , but can you tell me the way to the Today Mall ? ",
          " Yes , go down the fifth street . You won't miss it . ",
          " How long will it take me to get there ? ",
          " It's only about 10 minutes ' walk . ",
          " Thank you very much . ",
          "Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months , what are your general impression of it ? ",
          " I think , maybe , it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , I am no more than a beginner . But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life . ",
          " You mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? To some extent your idea holds water . Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . Now we are apt to treat it as an art . ",
          " An art ! You have a good point there . So it is called martial arts in English . The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . They even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating . ",
          " Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . Do you know Jin Yong ? ",
          " I know he is a martial arts fiction writer . But I've read none of his novels . ",
          " All of his works have been translated into English . I recommend you to read one or two works of his . You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture . When you go through the pages , you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone , but cover all walks of life . ",
          " I see . They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements . ",
          " Yes , take philosophy , for instance . What makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? It's not enough only to be formidable . It also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life . ",
          " So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ? ",
          " Indeed , you're exactly right ! ",
          "Julia , look at me ! I'm gaining weight . How could I lose weight ? Do you have any good ideas ? ",
          " Since summer is coming , I think swimming is a good way for you to do . ",
          " Are you sure ? ",
          " Of course ! Swimming can help you stay in shape by targeting all parts of your body . ",
          " Really ? Does swimming have other advantages ? ",
          " It could also help you increase vital capacity . ",
          " That ' s great . Okay , from now on I would swim three times a week . I hope I can get rid of the weight . ",
          " You will make it if you persist in it . ",
          "Look , I've got a problem here . Will you help me ? ",
          " I'm not sure if I can , but I'll try . ",
          "How may I help you , miss ? ",
          " I want to change my hairstyle . What would you suggest ? ",
          " Would you like to have a perm ? ",
          " Do you think it will suit me ? ",
          " Oh , absolutely . ",
          " Ok , I'll have it for a change . ",
          "Would you do me a favor ? ",
          " I'd be glad to . What is it ? ",
          "Hello . My name ' s Linda Brown . What can I do for you today ? ",
          " Hi . I ' m Tom Peterson . I ' m looking for a one-bedroom apartment . ",
          " Certainly . First , I would like to ask you some questions to identify your needs before I show you what we have . ",
          " That ' s fine . ",
          " What price range are you interested in ? ",
          " Well , between $ 350-400 a month . ",
          " Okay . Do you have a special location in mind ? ",
          " I ' d like to live somewhere near the university , or at least on a bus line . ",
          " When would you like to move in ? ",
          " As soon as possible . ",
          " How about the end of this month ? ",
          " Fine . ",
          " Are there any special features that you would like to have , such as , a dishwasher , a balcony , a swimming pool , central air conditionining , etc . ? ",
          " I would like to have a dishwasher and central air conditioning . ",
          " Okay . Here are the photos of the apartments that fit your preferences . ",
          " Thank you . This one looks nice . Is it near the university ? ",
          " Yes . It ' s only 5 minutes walk from the campus . ",
          " That ' s good . I ' d like to see it . ",
          "Excuse me . I'm afraid I got lost . Where am I on this map ? ",
          " We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city . ",
          " Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ? ",
          " Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right . ",
          "Okay , I ' ll take it . By the way , do you have delivery service ? ",
          " You don ' t need to carry the furniture home because we have delivery service . ",
          " Do you charge for delivery ? ",
          " Wo will deliver the goods to you for free . ",
          " Very good . Could you deliver it to this address ? ",
          " Sure . Please write down your name and your phone number . ",
          " OK . Can you tell me the delivery time ? ",
          " No later than tomorrow . ",
          " Thanks . ",
          "Hi , I'd like to have a beer . ",
          " Hi , good evening . Which kind of beer would you like ? ",
          " I'd like to try a local beer . What would you suggest ? ",
          " How about Yanking Beer ? It's very popular here . ",
          " Sounds good . I'll take that . ",
          "Good evening , sir . ",
          " Good evening . I'll have a Scotch . ",
          " Yes , sir . Straight or on the rocks ? ",
          " On the rocks , please . ",
          "Hello , ma'am . Can I help you ? ",
          " Yes , please . I'd like a gin and tonic . ",
          " Sure , ma'am . Here you are . ",
          " Thank you . How much is it ? ",
          " 25 yuan . ",
          " Here's 30 . Keep the change . ",
          " Thank you very much , ma'am , but we don't take tips in China . ",
          "Excuse me . I wonder if you could help me . I'm looking for the Oriental Pearl Theater . ",
          " Boy , you are lost . It's across town . ",
          " Oh ! What bad luck ! How can I get to the Theater ? ",
          " You can take a No . 12 bus here and then transfer to a No . 23 bus to get there . ",
          "What do you think about all the different diets people go on ? ",
          " I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! ",
          " But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? ",
          " They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . ",
          " So you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? ",
          " Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . ",
          " How about drinking soda ? ",
          " Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try some diet coke . ",
          " That's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ? ",
          " My mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . ",
          " How do you know so much about food and dieting ? ",
          " You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now ! ",
          "I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said . ",
          " I said , \" Do you want me to help you ? \" ",
          " If you're sure you're not in a hurry , I can use a little help . ",
          " OK . Would you like me to get you a cab ? ",
          "Hi , Mark . ",
          " Hi , Bill . I ' d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday . ",
          " All right . ",
          " So , what do we do now ? ",
          " This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords . ",
          " Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ' ll deposit one month ' s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ' s rent in advance . I understand that I ' ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs . ",
          " Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out . ",
          " Can I pay you by check ? ",
          " Sure . A check will be fine . ",
          " Is there a laundry room in the basement ? ",
          " Yes . ",
          " Can I sign the lease right now ? ",
          "Yes , ma'am , how could I help you ? ",
          " I am wondering if you do facial care ? ",
          " Yes , we do . ",
          " How much would it be ? ",
          " From 200 to 800 . ",
          " I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ? ",
          " No problem . ",
          "I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said . ",
          " I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? ' ",
          " I'm trying to find a post office . ",
          " Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there . ",
          " Should I take the bus ? ",
          " No . It'll only take about five minutes to walk . ",
          " Thank you very much . ",
          " Anytime . ",
          "Hello , Steven . Annie said that you and Julia have had a quarrel , haven ' t you ? ",
          " That ' s true . We had an argument yesterday . She blamed me for not preparing the supper that day , but it was her turn to cook the dinner . ",
          " That's the reason why you fought ? ",
          " Yes . ",
          " You two are always quarrelling over little things . ",
          " That wasn ' t my fault , but she said ' you're a disgrace ' to me . I'm about to explode ! ",
          " Are you still mad at her now ? ",
          " To be honest , I ' m not , and I regret a little what I have done . ",
          " Will you apologize to her ? ",
          " No way . It ' s her who should apologize . ",
          "Julia , I apologize to you for what I have done . Please forgive me . ",
          " I've already forgiven you . Actually , I also owe you an apology . I was so rude to you that day . ",
          " It does ' t matter . I know that people are easy to get mad when they're tired . ",
          " Thanks for your understanding . ",
          " You're welcome . Happy couples need mutual understanding . ",
          "Hi , I ' m the superintendent of this building . What can I do for you ? ",
          " Hi , I ' m Paul . Could you show me the apartment on the first floor ? ",
          " Sure . Let ' s go . ",
          " I like this one . How much is the rent ? ",
          " $ 850 a month . ",
          " Does the rent include utilities ? ",
          " No . Utilities are extra . ",
          " Where ' s the laundry room ? ",
          " It ' s on the other side of this floor . ",
          " What ' s your rule about pets ? ",
          " We allow one or two pets but you have to pay a $ 300 deposit . ",
          " How come ? ",
          " If your pet ruins the apartment walls or carpet we ' ll keep your pet deposit . If not , we ' ll return your deposit when you move out . But be careful , we don ' t allow pet snakes in the apartment . ",
          " who takes care of bug control ? ",
          " We do . We will spray the apartments before you move in . ",
          " Thank you very much for taking your time . I ' m still deciding . I will call you tomorrow . ",
          "Let me get the keys and we ' ll go to look at it . ",
          " Okay . ",
          " It ' s the one you like . ",
          " Wow ! It ' s really good for me , especially the living room . It is big enough to put all my stuff there . It ' s a deal ! I ' ll rent this one . ",
          " Okay . Now we need you to fill a form with your personal information . We need information like social insurance number ( Social security number in the US ) , your address , phone number , etc . We also need a security deposit of $ 200 . And you have to pay two months ' rent in advance for renting the first time . If there ' s nothing damaged , we ' ll give you back one month ' s rent when you move out . You ' ll be responsible for all the utilities . Do you want to sign a lease today ? ",
          " Sure ! ",
          " Oh , one more thing I forgot . You must let us know two months in advance if you want to stop renting within the contract . Otherwise , you can ' t get your deposit back . ",
          " Okay . Thank you for your reminder . ",
          " You ' re welcome . Be sure to get the keys one day before you move in . ",
          " Thank you again . ",

          " The tank is almost empty . I guess I ' ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up . ",
          " That ' s a good idea . Put your keys in the ignition , start it up , put the car in reserve , wait for the road to be clear , and then back out of the driveway . ",

          " We have plenty of postcards to choose from here . The same designs can be found on these posters . ",
          " Posters are difficult to travel with . I think I'll just buy the postcards . I heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in Venice . ",
          " Yes , we do . They're on the wall behind you . ",
          " How much do they cost ? ",
          " The prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . Would you like me to get one down for you to look at ? ",
          " Yes , I think I'd like the green mask in the middle . ",
          " Here you go . ",
          " I'll take it , I'd also like to buy some chocolate . ",
          " Are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift ? ",

          " Why don ' t you try it on and see how you feel about it ? ",
          " That ' s a great idea . I ' ll try it on . ",

          " Not too much . I'm looking to rent an apartment . ",
          " Why ? ",
          " I dislike my roommate . He really turns me off . ",
          " What happened ? Did you have a fight ? ",
          " No . He likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room . ",
          " I hate that , either . Did you tell him your feelings ? ",
          " Yes . But he doesn't care . I really wouldn't want to move , but I simply can ' t stand him . ",
          " It's a problem . You'd better move . ",
          "So , how should we get to the theatre ? ",
          " Let's take the bus . ",
          " I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . ",
          " It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . ",
          " It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . ",
          " We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . ",
          " Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . ",
          " If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? ",
          " We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . ",
          " I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus . ",
          " Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . ",
          " It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you . ",
          " Thanks , that was nice of you . ",
          " See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! ",
          "Is there anything I can do for you ? ",
          " Yes , what are your hours ? ",
          " We open at lo ",
          " Thanks lot . ",

          " Yes , I think so . ",
          " I do wish I could lose weight ",
          " Well , why don't you go on a diet ? ",
          " I've tried diets before but they've never worked . ",
          " Perhaps you should exercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class ? ",
          " Yes , maybe I should . ",
          "Excuse me . Do you know how to get to the mall ? ",

          " Yeah , but sometimes Bingo wants to play with me , but I don't have time . ",
          " So who takes care of him then ? ",
          " My little brother likes to play with him . He even gives him a bath every week . ",
          " I can't do that with my cat . She hates water . ",
          " You know , you're right . Maybe you should get a dog . ",

          " His name is Bingo . ",
          " What kind of dog is he ? ",

          " Well , he sure likes to run around a lot . Is he well behaved ? ",
          " Oh yes , he is . When he was a puppy , he liked to chew my father's shoes , but he's okay now . ",
          " That sounds like my cat . She likes to scratch the couch with her claws . ",
          " I didn't know you had a cat . When did you get her ? ",
          " About a year ago actually . You've probably never seen her though . ",
          " Really ? Why is that ? ",
          " She's not a house-cat . She stays outside most of the time . ",
          " Bingo could never do that . He stays in the house except when we take him to the park . ",

          " OK , how was everything ? ",
          " Very nice . Thank you . ",

          " Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time . We should be able to down it before they close . ",
          " That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ? ",
          " It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ? ",
          " Yeah . I think I can find it . ",
          " You're back already . That sure was quick . ",
          " That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me . ",
          " Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer.Anyway.He said it was too close to closing time . ",
          " Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway . ",
          " Okay , let's go ! ",
          "Now , madam , here is the Hotel . ",
          " What's the fare ? ",
          " $ 15 . ",
          " The fare is different from the meter . ",
          " Well , madam , the meter was not on at all . You didn't tell me . ",
          " But I thought it was . Anyway . I am in a hurry . Here is the money . ",
          "Excuse me , driver . Let me off here , please . ",
          " Well , it's not the supermarket you want . ",
          " I have just changed my plan . ",
          " OK . ",
          " Here is the fare and keep the change please . ",
          "Excuse me , Ma ' am . I would like to mail this package door to door via airmail to London . It is a very important package and has to be sent within 3 days . ",
          " No problem . But , the postage is much higher than the regular package . ",
          " That's fine with me . I am willing to pay for it as long as you can guarantee me the package can arrive in time . ",
          " OK . All the registered airmail packages can be received in 5 working days . ",

          " Sure ! Please just fill in your I . D . number and ways to contact you here . ",
          " Do I need to include my zip code in the address ? ",
          " You had better include that because it is easier for the mailmen to find the correct mailing address . ",
          " Thank you very much . Here is 500 dollars . ",
          " Here is your receipt . Contact us if your friend still doesn't receive the package after 5 work days . ",
          "Thank God , it's Friday ! Time for a drink ! Let's hit the bars ! ",
          " OK . I don't mind going bar hopping with an expert like you . ",
          " Should we start with beer or wine or go straight to the hard liquor ? ",
          " I think I'll have a glass of wine . Let's see ... they have red wine , white wine and port . They even have sangria ! It's the happy hour special . ",
          " Port's too sweet . It's a dessert wine . A dry red French wine would be nice with meat . A glass of chilled white German wine would be good with fish . But , we're not eating and it's hot out , so I think I'll have a tall glass of sangria with ice . ",
          " Good choice ! But , what's your favorite kind of hard liquor ? ",
          " I like to stick to the clean stuff , like vodka , gin , white rum and other clear spirits . ",
          "Excuse me , can I have a look at the green coat ? ",
          " Certainly . Here you are . It's a new arrival . ",
          " Yes , I like the style.Can I try this on ? ",
          " Sure . The fitting room is in the corner . ",
          "It's a beautiful day ! Let's play on those rides in the park . ",
          " Sounds like a good idea . I love to play on the jungle gym . ",
          " Me too . I love to play on the swing as well . Swing is my favorite . ",
          " That's great . Then we won't fight over taking the same ride . ",
          " Look at the flowers over there . What are they ? ",
          " They are morning glories . They are cute , aren't they ? ",
          " They are . We can find many different kinds of flowers and insects in the park . ",
          " I think so . Last time I saw dandelions and ladybugs near the pond . ",
          " If you come to the park in the morning , you can find squirrels running on the lawn . ",
          " It's really healthy to do some exercise there . The air is fresher and it's romantic to watch the sunset with your lover . ",
          " Well , off we go . I am sure we can have a great time . ",
          "Do you have sport shirts for ladies ? ",
          " There are different types . Which one do you like best ? ",
          " I think the red one fits me well . Can I try it on ? ",
          " Surely , of course . ",
          " Where is the fitting room ? ",
          " It's there , near the mirror . ",
          "The dress looks beautiful . Can I touch it ? ",
          " I am sorry , miss , it's not allowed unless you want to buy it . ",
          " I see . What about the dress over there ? I would like to try it on . ",
          " OK , here you are . The fitting room is behind the curtain . ",
          "Are you looking for shoes ? ",
          " Yes , could you give me some ideas ? ",
          " What about this brown one ? ",
          " Fine , it's the thing for me . I will take it . ",
          "Can I try this dress on ? ",
          " Sure.the fitting room is right behind you . ",
          " Well , I like the styte , but I don't think the color fits me . Could you bring me a green one ? ",
          " Sure , wait a moment . ",
          "Could you give me some advice ? ",
          " The dress is made on your measurement . ",
          " It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I will like it better . ",
          " OK , maybe you can try this one on . It's yellow . ",
          "Oh , my god . I am so heavy now . I gain 10 kilos . ",
          " I am going to the gym . Do you want to come with me ? ",
          " I think I should go . I really need to lose some weight . ",
          " Then , I'll wait for you at the car park in 20 minutes . ",
          " 0K.See you then . ",
          " Do you have your member card with you ? ",
          " Nope , I do not have a membership yet . ",
          " Well I have a guest ticket . You can use it . ",
          " That is so nice of you . If I like the service and the training equipment , I think I well join the club . ",
          "I can't find my glasses and I can't see anything . Can you help me find a few things ? ",
          " No problem . What are you looking for ? ",
          " My laptop , do you see it ? ",
          " Yes , your laptop is on the chair . ",
          " Where's my book ? ",
          " Which one ? ",
          " The dictionary . ",
          " It's under the table . ",
          " Where's my pencil ? ",
          " There's a pencil in front of the lamp . ",
          " That's not a pencil . That's a pen . ",
          " Oh , sorry . There is a pencil behind the cup . ",
          " How about my backpack ? Do you know where that is ? ",
          " It's in between the wall and the bed . ",
          " Where are my shoes ? ",
          " They're on the left side of the TV . ",
          " I don't see them . ",
          " Sorry , I made a mistake . They're on the right side of the TV . ",
          " Thanks . ",
          " Oh , and here are your glasses . They were next to your cell phone . ",
          "This one is too small . Please bring me a bigger one . ",
          " OK . ",
          " What's the brand ? ",
          " Leopard . It's famous brand of good quality . ",
          " This one suits better . I will take it . ",
          "I want to buy a black suit . ",
          " Certainty.Do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit ? ",
          " I prefer single breasted suit . ",
          " What about this one ? It's a very nice 3 - piece suit . ",
          " That looks great . Do you have ties here ? ",
          "Could I be of any help to you ? ",
          " I want to buy a skirt , but I have no idea which one to buy . ",
          " Do you like miniskirt ? It's popular among young girls . The pleated skirt also sells well . ",
          " I don't like to keep up with joneses . ",
          " What about the divided skirt ? ",
          " I think this suits me . Can I try it on ? ",
          "Do you have the same in different sizes ? The trousers are too long for me . ",
          " Let me see . Yes , here you are . ",
          " Will the trousers shrink when washed ? ",
          " No , they won't . They are shrink proof . ",
          " That's good . I will take it . ",
          "Do you get up early every morning ? ",
          " About 6 in the morning . I like to walk to the office . ",
          " Good habit . How long does it take ? ",
          " About 20 minutes . Do you live alone ? ",
          " No , my little sister lives with me . ",
          " How old is she ? ",
          " About 12 . She is a good girl . ",
          " I think so . ",
          "OK , Lucy.It ' s your turn.Are you ready ? ",
          " I really would rather just listen.Isn ' t there anyone else who wants to sing ? ",
          " Come on ! In the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song ! ",
          " I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night . ",
          " Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis ' song for him . ",
          " I'll put the song at the front of the list . ",
          "Who wants to go first ? Lily ? ",
          " Oh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ? ",
          " OK.Put on something by the Backstreet Boys ! ",
          " How about As Long as You Love Me ? You can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee Brooke ! ",
          " I'd better not . Brooke hates the Backstreet Boys ! ",
          "I've been learning to play go recently . It's an amazing game ! ",
          " Weigh ? It must be a greatest Chinese invention . I've tried hard to learn it . Its rules can't be any simpler , but I've never won a game of Go . Well , it's all Greek to me ! ",
          " At least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you ? I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go . ",
          " I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ? ",
          " Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness . ",
          " I know it is quite different from Western chess . ",
          " Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill . ",
          " But isn't it the same with wiki ? ",
          " Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive . ",
          "May I take a look at the shoes over there ? ",
          " Certainly . What's your size ? ",
          " Size 24 . Are they synthetic or leather ? ",
          " They are all leather . How do they feel ? ",
          " It's comfortable . I will take it . ",
          "Try it on in front of the mirror . ",
          " Well , I think the color is a little too bright . ",
          " We have darker ones . Do you like the style ? ",
          " Yes . What's this made of and how to wash it ? ",
          " lt's made of silk and you had better wash it by hand in cold water . ",
          "Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mic ! ",
          " If I hear Love Me Tender one more time , I think I'll go crazy ! ",
          " He sounds like a sick cow ! ",
          " Can we adjust the pitch a little ? Maybe he'll sound better in a higher key . ",
          " I already tried that . Nothing seems to help . ",

I don ' t honestly like that kind of stuff . \",\" Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette . \",\" What ' s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . \",\" Not for me , Dick . \",\"Are things still going badly with your houseguest ? \",\" Getting worse . Now he ' s eating me out of house and home . I ' Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . \",\" Leo , I really think you ' re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ' s time to lay down the law . \",\" You ' re right . Everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . I ' ll keep you informed . \",\"Would you mind waiting a while ? \",\" Well , how long will it be ? \",\" I'm not sure . But I'll get a table ready as fast as I can . \",\" OK .

I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ' m just not into this health kick . \",\" Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ' t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain . \",\" I am wiped out . Thank you . \",\" Look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes .

See . \",\" Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ? \",\" Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG . \",\" What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food . \",\" According to some studies it may cause cancer . \",\" Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population . \",\" I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated . \",\" I don't know exactly . It's a tradition .

Sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual as we have steak from the market every day . \",\" So what ? It is not fresh and I'm not happy about it . \",\" I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course . \",\" No , thank you . \",\"I'm looking for a white purse as a gift .

Aren't the four Cs , cut , clarity , carat and color . \",\" You've got it . Tell me a little bit about what you might be wanted . \",\" Well , my price range is a 5,000 dollars to 7,000 dollars , I'm looking for a marquise cut on the wide band . \",\" You have good taste . Let my show you what I have . \",\"Would you like a lift home ? \",\" That would be great . Thanks ! \",\"Mike's Mechanics .

We have black , white and transparent panty-hose here . \",\"Do you have any fresh baked donuts for sale yet ? \",\" They will be ready in about half an hour . Do you need anything else ? \",\" Yes , I'd like five croissants , too . \",\" It's going to be 3 dollars 40 cents . \",\"Taxi ! \",\" Yes , sir . Where to ? \",\" Wangfujing , please ! \",\" All right . \",\" Oh , I like the music on your radio . It's nice . \",\" Thank you ! I always tune to this program when driving . So what's your favorite program ? \",\" I like Winner's English very mush . You know the Beijing Olympic Games is right around the corner . We should learn English Well . It's on FM 96.6 , China Business Radio . You can get it on your radio too . \",\" But I don't speak English at all . \",\" That's OK . The program is especially for the beginners like us . \",\" Really ? When is it on ? \",\" It begins at 6:40 every morning , and it goes for 20 minutes . \",\" Thank you so much . I'll try and catch that . \",\" The radio has brought us lots of convenience . \",\" Yes , I can also learn about the traffic condition through it . \",\" With the development of the society and technology , radio is nearly everywhere . \",\" So we should take the advantage of it . \",\"Do you have these shoes in a size 7 ? \",\" Yes . Let me get you a pair . \",\"What a mess ! \",\" Sorry . I'll clean it up . \",\"I wonder if we can change to Channel 5 . \",\" Why ? \",\" I want to know what's on that channel . \",\" Oh , good . \",\" There is a football match . \",\" I prefer TV play to football . \",\" OK . Could you turn it down ? \",\" What are you going to do ? \",\" I'm going to listen to the radio . \",\" Maybe we can enjoy the TV play together . It's interesting . \",\"Excuse me , can you show me the cloisonn bracelet in the counter ? \",\" Sure . Let me get it for you . \",\" Can you also show me this one ? \",\" No problem . This one is made of pure gold . \",\" I think the cloisonn bracelet is more beautiful . \",\" You ' re right .

Go to bed right now . \",\"May I speak to Peter ? \",\" Who's calling ? \",\"It's so boring . \",\" Don't you like it ? \",\" I don't . Is there anything worth watching on the other channel ? \",\" I think it's a basketball match on channel 5 . \",\" Do you mind if we switch over ? \",\" Well , I'd rather see a movie . \",\" What's the movie ? \",\" ' Star war ' . \",\" It must be interesting . \",\" Yes , you're right . \",\"Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ? \",\" It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . \",\" Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ? \",\" News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on . \",\" Is there anything interesting ? \",\" Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education . \",\" I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ? \",\" Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs . \",\" That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ? \",\" Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals . \",\" I got it . Do you pay for the programs ? \",\" Yes , 50 Yuan per month . \",\" It is a little bit expensive , but it's worth it . \",\" Yeah . You know driving is boring . TV can get me out of the fatigue of driving . \",\" It can also entertain your passengers like me . \",\" That's the point . \",\"Jenny , you're too lazy . You should do some exercise . See , you're getting fat . \",\" Dad , it's raining outside . \",\" That is your excuse . \",\" All right , all right , I will go swimming with Peter this afternoon . \",\" Not just today . Go exercise everyday ! \",\"Peter , enough with your computer games . Go do your homework now . \",\" Can't I play more ? \",\" No ! Stop playing computer games ! \",\" Mom , I'll be finished soon . \",\" Peter , if you don't turn off your computer , then I won't allow you to play it again starting next week . \",\"Hi , who has the remote control ? \",\" I do . Why , do you want me to change the channel ? \",\" Yes , please . I can't stand watching the channel any more . \",\" I think they have pretty good programmes . But I'll change it if you really want . \",\" Put it on Channel 5 , OK ? \",\" Oh , I hate Channel 5 . I'd rather just listen to the radio . \",\" Don't make such a fuss . I'm sure you will like today's programme . \",\" What's on today ? \",\" A basketball match between Chinese team and American team . \",\" Really ? I'm interested in it . \",\" It might begin now . \",\"Peter , where are you going ? \",\" I'm going to do some shopping . \",\" Won't you watch TV ? \",\" What's on TV tonight ? Is there a football match ? \",\" The TV station will air the World Cup football match alive at 8: 30 . \",\" Really ? Who will play ? \",\" The Brazilian team versus the American team . Don't miss it . \",\" That's cool . I'll watch it . \",\" Who do you think will win ? \",\" There is no doubt that the Brazilian team will win . \",\" I think so . \",\"May I have a cookie ? \",\" Help yourself . \",\"By the way , where's Jim ? \",\" He is out . \",\"Watch out ! \",\" Wow ! That car almost hit me . \",\"Eat some more . \",\" No , thanks . I'm on a diet . \",\"Hurry up , will you ? \",\" What's the rush ? \",\"Kata ! You've got a beautiful singing voice . You hit the high notes perfectly . \",\" Thank you for your compliment . But you are exaggerating . I think you are destined to be a singer . You have the best voice ! \",\" Thank you . Maybe we can sing a song together . Would you like to sing with me ? \",\" Yes , I'd like to . It's my honor . Let's pick a song . \",\" How about this one ? \",\" Sorry , I can't sing the song . \",\" Er ... How about this one ? \",\" OK . But I'm not familiar . I don't know the beginning part . \",\" Never mind . You can follow me . I'll sing the first part . \",\" OK . \",\"Peter , go and tidy up your toys now . \",\" Wait a moment , mom . \",\" I'm mad ! I said now ! Turn off the TV , and do it now . \",\" Mom , just ten more minutes . The show is going to be over soon . \",\" Peter , if you don't do it soon , I will throw your toys in the trash can . \",\"Sorry , I'm late . \",\" It doesn't matter . \",\"Excuse me , I've been waiting here for 10 minutes . Do you know how often does No . 636 run ? \",\" It runs every 15 minutes . You must have missed it . \",\" It seems you got here at good time . Do you have a bus schedule ? \",\" Yes , I do . You can buy a bus schedule in a news stand . \",\" I see , thank you . By the way , is this the right bus for the Museum ? \",\" Yes , it is . \",\" Do I have to change ? \",\" No . The Museum is the terminal of this bus . \",\" Thanks a lot . \",\" You are welcome . \",\"Mom , can I have more allowance ? \",\" What for ? \",\" I want to buy more books . \",\" Oh , yeah ? Are you joking ? \",\" Of course not ! I'm telling the truth . \",\" Honey , it's good if you spend money to buy more books . But $ 100 dollars a week is enough for you already . \",\"Two burgers , please . \",\" For here or to go ? \",\"Dad , may I have a room of my own ? \",\" Oh , honey , I'm so sorry , we don't have enough space for you to have your own room . \",\" Dad , but I don't want to share a room with Peter . He snores every night . \",\" Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ? \",\" Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it . \",\"Open the book and turn to page 10 . \",\" It is difficult . \",\" No , honey , it's easy if you know the way . \",\" Do I have to memorize it ? \",\" No , honey , try to make notes in your notebook . \",\"Peter , wash your hands first , and then have some dessert . \",\" Mom , can I have some ice cream ? \",\" Not today , Honey . Don't eat too much ice cream . \",\" Mom , can I have one more piece of cake ? \",\" Ok . The last piece is for your dessert . We're having dinner soon . \",\"Dad , can you help me ? \",\" Oh , honey , you made a mistake . \",\" I don't know how to do it . \",\" OK . Let's do it together . \",\" 16 divided by 2 . What's the answer ? \",\" 16 divided by 2 equals 8 . \",\" You got it . Good job . \",\"How was your test ? \",\" It was bad . \",\" Oh , honey , you should study harder . \",\" But I already tried my best . \",\" Don't worry . You'll do better next time . \",\"Is Bob home ? \",\" Sorry . You've got the wrong number . \",\"Dad , how do you say this word ? \",\" Sword , say it ' sword ' . \",\" What does this word mean ? \",\" Look it up in the dictionary . \",\" Dad , can you just tell me what it means ? I'm too lazy . \",\" No , honey , go and read it . You'll learn . \",\"Jenny , what's your favorite color ? \",\" I like red . \",\" Now , we're going to draw an apple in your sketch book . What do we use ? \",\" Dad , I want to draw with crayons , can I ? \",\" Why not ? Let's draw the outline of an apple with your pencil first . \",\"Mom , my nose is bleeding . \",\" What happened , Peter ? Did you have a fight ? \",\" No , mom . I didn't . \",\" Did somebody hit you ? Or did you just fall ? \",\" Mom ! I was just picking my nose , and now it's bleeding . \",\"Something's wrong with my air conditioning . \",\" Leave it to me . I'll fix it . \",\"Mom , I don't feel well . \",\" Are you sick ? \",\" I feel dizzy . \",\" Let me take your temperature . \",\" Mom , I don't want to go to see a doctor . \",\" Oh , honey , I think you've caught a cold , you should get a shot . \",\"What do you want to be ? \",\" Dad , I haven't thought about it . I'm still young . \",\" Oh , honey , but you must know what your hobby is , right ? \",\" I like playing the piano . \",\" Yes , you play the piano well . You could be a good pianist . That's good . \",\"Where are you off to ? \",\" The movies . \",\"May I have the menu , please ? \",\" Sure . Here you go . \",\"Peter , do you want to learn to play the piano ? \",\" No , mom . Piano is for girls . \",\" Well , there are many boys that can play the piano very well , like Jay Chou . \",\" No way , mom . I don't like piano . \",\" OK . But you have to promise me that you will study hard in your English class . \",\" All right , all right . I understand . \",\"Jenny , Can you come and help me ? \",\" Mom , what should I do ? \",\" It's dusty everywhere in the house . Can you help me do the housecleaning ? \",\" OK . I will call Peter to clean it together . \",\" That's my good girl . The clothes need washing . I'll do the laundry . \",\"Mom , what are we going to make tonight ? \",\" Curry and rice . What do you think ? \",\" That sounds nice . I can peel the potatoes first . \",\" Really ! Oh , honey , you are so sweet . I'll chop up this carrot . \",\" Mom , the water is boiling ! \",\" Honey , just turn down the stove . \",\"Can you make out what he's saying ? \",\" No , it's too loud in here . \",\"It's your turn now , Helen . \",\" OK . I'm coming . \",\" This is your song . I picked it for you . \",\" Thank you . You are so considerate . \",\" Push the red button on the mike to turn it on . \",\" OK . This key is too high for me . \",\" I think it's a piece of cake for you . \",\" OK . Let me have a try ... \",\" Well done ! I hope I can sing as well as you one day . \",\" Thank you . I'm sure you will . \",\" I hope so . Thank you for saying so . \",\"Dinner's ready ! Come and get it ! \",\" Coming ! \",\"Have you got a minute ? \",\" Sure . What's up ? \",\"Who is the next one ? \",\" It's Peter's turn . \",\" Give the mike to him . \",\" OK . \",\" Be quiet . He is singing . \",\" I thought he only liked to listen ! \",\" So did I . \",\" He has a really good voice ! \",\" Yes , he sings wonderfully . \",\"Can you pass me the lighter ? \",\" Here . Catch ! \",\"Have you ever sung with a karaoke ? \",\" Yes , I do it quite often . \",\" Karaoke has become a major entertainment . I wonder why . \",\" Simple , it's fun . \",\" How much fun is there in singing in front of other people , especially if you don't sing well ? \",\" Ah , that's the biggest fun of all . You see , even though you're not a good singer , people will listen to you . \",\" I wouldn't do that . \",\" But I like the feeling . \",\"What kind of music do you like ? \",\" I like popular music best . \",\" Me too . \",\" Who is your favorite singer ? \",\" Qi In is . \",\" Do you know this song ? \",\" Yes , I like it very much . \",\" Let's sing it together , shall we ? \",\" No problem . \",\"Who's it for ? \",\" It's for you . \",\"How much does this cost ? \",\" Sixty dollars . \",\"May I use your phone ? \",\" Go ahead . \",\"Where's the toilet ? \",\" Over there . \",\"Watch out , Jenny ! Be careful of the cars . \",\" I'm fine , dad . \",\" Did you get hit ? \",\" No , dad . Can I go there to play ball ? \",\" Watch out for strangers , and don't go too far away . Alright ? \",\"Do you shop online often ? \",\" Every so often . It is very convenient and the price is lower than in stores . \",\" Are there many things online ? \",\" Books , cosmetics , daily necessities , even large electrical appliance can be ordered from online-stores . \",\" Incredible . I really want to survey the on-line virtual supermarket . \",\" Even you can bargain with the owner of one on-line store , although he or she provides ' But It Now ' prices . \",\" What are the disadvantages of on-line shopping ? \",\" Some provide wrong pictures for the goods , so many buyers are deceived . \",\"Peter , it's time to go home now ! Hurry up ! \",\" Ten more minutes , mom . Please ! \",\" Honey , it's almost noon . We have to go home and make lunch for your sister . \",\" I bet she will hang around with her mates after school . \",\" Peter , it's a quarter to twelve . Let's go home now ! \",\"Don't tell me you're pregnant again . \",\" I'm afraid so . \",\"I am keen on a coat on www.dingding.com . But it requires having an online banking account . Is it necessary ? \",\" Indeed . Online banking enables you to make on-line shopping . \",\" Do you know how to get the bank account ? \",\" Bring your ID card and fill out a form . That will be fine . \",\" So easy . \",\" I think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than ATM processing speed . \",\" My shopping life will be more convenient . \",\"Honey , I need to have a talk with you . \",\" Dad , I have to do my homework . \",\" No , honey , why didn't you go to cram school last night ? \",\" Dad , I don't want to talk about it now . \",\" Honey , if you don't want to go to cram school , you should tell me the reason why . \",\" I'm sorry , dad . But I would rather stay at school than go to cram school . \",\"Do you have any plan to buy a house in this city ? \",\" Absolutely we need a house here . But what makes me upset is the prices in this city . \",\" Our monthly salary can not buy one square meter of the house here . \",\" It is depressing to hear the price goes higher and higher . \",\" More and more people need to buy houses , but the market can not meet the needs , so this caused the bubble in real estate industry . \",\" And the rich still wants to buy more , even though they have at least one house to live . \",\" Have you watched the TV series , Humble Abode ? \",\" Yes , it displays some social problems and interprets the values of our white-collars . \",\" I really , really want a house , even though it is small like a snail house . \",\"Stop burping . \",\" I can't help it . \",\"Can you give me a hand ? \",\" Of course . \",\"Let's go now . \",\" I'll be with you in a minute . \",\"Kate , can we change the channel ? \",\" Why ? \",\" This channel has so many advertisements , and it doesn't have any good TV programs . \",\" OK . You can change it . \",\" What about this one ? Do you like this program ? \",\" No , I think it is very boring . Can you change it to Channel Twelve , please ? \",\" Yes . Oh , it's a talk show . \",\" Yeah , it's very funny . Have you ever watched it before ? \",\" No , I haven't . This is my first time to watch it . \",\" I'm sure you will like it . \",\"Mom , can I watch TV ? \",\" No more today , honey . \",\" Alright , Mom . Should I turn off the TV right now ? \",\" Yes , honey . Go to your room , and take out your book . It's your reading time now . \",\" Mom , where is the remote ? I can't find it . \",\" Just go to read . I will find it , honey . \",\"OK , Tom . It's your turn . Are you ready ? \",\" I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ? \",\" Come on ! In the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song ! \",\" I know , but ... Hey , Jim's here ! I've been waiting to hear him sing all night . \",\" Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him ? He loves ' The King ' . \",\" I'll put the song at the front of the list . \",\"Can you give me a hand with my luggage ? \",\" Of course . \",\"Peter , have you seen my purse ? \",\" No , mom . I haven't seen it . \",\" That's strange . It should be on the desk . \",\" Mom , did you try the basket on your bicycle ? \",\" Not yet . Let me see . \",\"Hello , I'm sorry for calling this late . May I speak to Peter ? \",\" I'm sorry . He's not in right now . \",\" When is he coming back ? \",\" He should be back in ten minutes . Could 1 you call back later ? \",\" I'll call again in thirty minutes . \",\"I received an E-mail from mother today . \",\" What did she say ? \",\" She missed us and asked when we would go back home . \",\" What's your plan ? \",\" I don't know . Maybe next week . We haven't been to the Great Wall yet . \",\" Right , then you'd better send an E-mail to tell her . \",\" All right . \",\"These vegetables taste very sweet . \",\" Sure , I planted them . They're organic . \",\" Really ? Dad , how do you know how to plant organic vegetable ? \",\" Well , it's a secret . \",\" Dad , come on ! Just tell me . \",\" Well , honey , I can teach you how to plant them if you want to learn . \",\"Do you know anything about health food ? \",\" It is so popular among people to preserve health now , so I read some books about health food . \",\" Can you give me some examples ? \",\" Drinking warm and fresh water in the morning on wakening up is one of ways to keep healthy . \",\" Really ? Why we must have warm and fresh water ? \",\" Warm water can be good for your stomach , which is empty at that moment . And freshness can keep the water active to clean your digest system . \",\" Anything else ? \",\" Yogurt , because it has protein , vitamins and it is acidic . If you drink it everyday , your stomach will be more comfortable . \",\"Our dinner is ready . \",\" What do we have for the dinner now ? \",\" Potatoes , tomatoes and cucumber . \",\" Do you feed rabbits ? \",\" It is said that greens can improve our metabolism . In addition , I want to keep fit . \",\" Where is my favorite white bread ? Is it in refrigerator ? \",\" I didn't buy any of it at all . Most health food are good for you , but don't taste good . \",\" Do you prepare some dessert for me ? \",\" I am clear about your sweet tooth , so I made a mixed fruit dish for you . \",\" Are you trying to change our eating patterns ? \",\"How much was your watch ? \",\" Take a guess . \",\"Mom , did you see Andy's dog ? \",\" Honey , don't tell me that you want a pet dog also . \",\" Mom , please . Can I have a pet dog like Andy's ? \",\" Honey , you know , we don't have enough room for a pet dog . \",\" Mom , we can keep it on the balcony , right ? \",\" No , honey , the balcony is full of boxes and things . I'm sorry . \",\"Jenny , what are you going to do tomorrow morning ? \",\" I don't know yet . What's your idea , Dad ? \",\" I'm thinking of taking you and Peter swimming . What do you think ? \",\" Dad ! It's cold now ! \",\" But swimming in the winter is good for your body . Believe me . \",\"Dad , I've finished my homework . \",\" Well , what game do you want to play ? \",\" Do you want to play poker ? \",\" Do you know how to play it ? \",\" I'll teach you . \",\" OK . Teach me how to play the game . \",\"I would like to buy a black suit . \",\" Do you have any special brand in your mind ? \",\" No , I never wear suit in my everyday life . I just want one to take part in my sister ' s wedding ceremony . \",\" I see . Have a look at this one . It ' s very cheap because it ' s not very durable . \",\" but it looks good . Let me try it on . \",\" Ok , the mirror is over there . \",\"Are you being served , madam ? \",\" No . Um , do you carry any padded coat ? \",\" Yes , what size is in your mind ? \",\" Small size . \",\" Any particular brand ? \",\" Whatever . You know , I ' m thinking of a gift for my mother . It ' s her 60 birthday next Friday . Could you give me some advice ? You are the expert . \",\" How about this one ? It ' s the latest design , simple but elegant . \",\" Looks nice . How much do you charge ? \",\" $ 100 . \",\" That ' s sheer robbery . I ' m sure you can do better than that . \",\" How much would you say ? \",\" $ 80 . \",\"can I see these silk ties ? \",\" No problem . \",\" I ' ll take this one . \",\" Good . Anything else ? The tie pins ? The cuff links ? \",\" No , thank you . I want to have a look at that scarf . \",\" Ok . We have several kinds of scarves here . Let me get them for you . Just wait a minute . \",\" Oh . I like this one . I have been looking for this color and design . Please wrap it for me , and I ' ll take it . \",\"Did your eye doctor prescribe you contact lenses ? \",\" No , I ' d like to know something about contact lenses . \",\" Oh , I see . We have both hard and soft contact lenses . They are very popular , but a little more expensive than ordinary glasses . \",\" I have found I ' m short-sighted recently . I need to wear glasses . As a student , it ' s better for me to wear ordinary glasses instead of contact lenses . \",\" We have many kinds of glasses here . Which frames do you like best ? \",\" I think the square-shaped ones will be the best for me . \",\" What about this pair ? They are the ' in ' things now in optical wear . Try them on . \",\" They fit me very well . I like them . \",\" Please go to receive optometry first over there . \",\"May I help you , madam ? \",\" Yes . I ' m trying to find a pair of earrings to match my necklace . Can you recommend some to me ? \",\" Yes . Your gold necklace has a diamond pendant , and your eardrops should be \",\" These look wonderful . Do these come with a guarantee of quality ? \",\" Of course .

Check the meat department . There is a fish counter there too . \",\" I already looked , but did not see anything . \",\" Let me show you . \",\" Thanks . \",\" See , it's right over there . \",\" Oh , gosh . I didn't see it . \",\" That's all right . \",\"Could you show me some scarves ? \",\" What kind of scarf shall I show you ? We have them in all sorts and sizes . \",\" Show me some of the latest fashion , please . \",\" At your service . Will this suit you ? \",\" Yes , it will ; this must be the foreign produce . \",\" This is Chinese made . \",\" Let me try it on . I think it really suits me . Can you give me some discount on it ? \",\" Yes , it ' s already fifty yuan off the original price . \",\" But that still sounds expensive . \",\" Sorry , we can ' t come down any more . \",\"Where's the nearest bank ? \",\" It's just around the corner \",\"Thanks for your help . \",\" No problem . \",\"Hey , how are you doing ? \",\" Could you do me a favor ? \",\" Sure , whatever you need . \",\" Can you help me move this table ? \",\"Could you do me a favor ? \",\" It depends . \",\"I like these shoes . \",\" Do you realize that all these shoes are half off ? \",\" Really ? \",\" Yes , but the offer only lasts this week . \",\"What would you like to eat tonight ? \",\" I'm not sure , what about you ? \",\" Do you think Kentucky fried chicken is good ? \",\" Sure sounds good to me . \",\"I'm going to paint the house today . \",\" Are you sure there is enough paint for the house ? \",\" Maybe not . Could you buy some while you're out ? \",\" No problems .

My silk dress is shrunk . How did you wash it ? \",\" It was washed by washing machine . \",\" It should be handwashed with cold water . It's a common sense . Don't you know it ? \",\" I'm so sorry . I have no idea of it . I washed silk dress the first time . I'll buy a new one for you or I'll give you money . \",\" That's all right . Please ask me if you don't know how to do something next time . You can keep the silk dress if you don't mind . I think it fits you . \",\" It's very nice of you . I'll try my best to do my job well . \",\"Good morning , Mary . \",\" How do you want your egg cooked ? \",\" Sunny side up , please . \",\" Okay , it'll be ready in two minutes . \",\"Can I give you a hand ? \",\" Thanks . \",\"Good morning , Miss . \",\" Good morning . Could you tell me where I can find the Clothing Department ? \",\" On the left of the elevator of the 3rd floor . \",\" I ' d like to buy a woolen vest for my grandpa . \",\" I ' m sure you can find your favorite there . \",\" Thank you very much . \",\" It ' s my honor . \",\"Hi , sir . Come and have a look here . We have all kinds of sweaters . \",\" I ' m looking for a sweater for my wife . Tomorrow is her birthday . And I know she needs a woolen sweater . \",\" How do you like this grey one ? It ' s pure wool , one hundred percent of Xinjiang wool . \",\" It feels good .

It's to raise money for the homeless . \",\" What about the performance itself ? \",\" Oh , it's a reserved opera named ' The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven ' . \",\" Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King .

You need it to get out of the station when you get there . \",\"Have you got change for a thousand ? \",\" Let me see . \",\"Excuse me , I'm a little lost .

Here it is . What do you want ? \",\" I need to buy some pork for the party . Give me about one kilogram . \",\" OK . Wait a second , please . \",\" I wonder if the chops are fresh . \",\" Yes , of course . \",\" One kilogram , too . \",\" Anything else ? \",\" No , thanks . \",\"What can I do for you ? \",\" I'd like to buy some milk powder . What would you recommend ? \",\" We have many kinds of different purpose . I wonder whom you are buying for ? \",\" My son . He is two years old . \",\" I see , sir . This one is very good . \",\" Is it ? \",\" You may rest assured . It sells well . \",\" May I have a look at the introduction ? \",\" Certainly . Here it is . \",\"Hey , Ann . Wake up . It's time to get out of bed . \",\" Oh , Dad . Do I have to get up right now ? \",\" Yes , or you'll be late . \",\" Why didn't my alarm go off today ? \",\" It went off 30 minutes ago . \",\" I must have slept right through it . \",\" Rise and shine . \",\" OK . I know . \",\"Ouch ! I just bit my tongue . \",\" Oh , that hurts . \",\" I think it's bleeding . \",\"Are you going grocery shopping today ? \",\" I am , as a matter of fact . Do you have any special requests ? \",\" Yes , please get some white bread , thick cut , some ham , not the processed stuff , some gouda cheese , some galla apples and . . . \",\" Wait . This is sounding like a major list . Why don't you just come with me ? \",\"I want to get in shape . I feel like a fence sitter-not really fat , but not really healthy . \",\" I know what you mean . I fit into my clothes , but I'm not always comfortable . \",\" Would you like to get in shape together ? \",\" What do you have in mind ? \",\" How about going to the gym ? There's one really close to work . \",\" I know the one you mean . Do you know how much the memberships are ? \",\" As a matter of fact , they are having a promotion right now . \",\" Let's go after work and take a tour of the facilities . \",\"Ahahah ! What is that thing on your couch ! It just moved ! \",\" Did you think it wasn't real ? That's my pet lizard . \",\" You have a pet lizard ? Somehow I never would have imagined that . \",\" His name is Grunt . Come closer and I'll properly introduce you . \",\" Does it bite or scratch ? \",\" No , he's perfectly harmless . And he's not afraid of strangers either . Here , hold him . \",\" Wow . He's heavy ! And his skin feels really cool . \",\" Stick around and you'll get to know him better . He has a very unusual personality . \",\"Mom . I have to go school shopping . There's only one more week left . \",\" Do you need money or what ? \",\" I have this list of stuff that I need and I only have half the dough . \",\" Half the dough huh . Well . How would you like to earn the other half ? \",\" Do I have a choice ? Uh . That's a no . What can I do ? \",\" I thought you'd never ask . The lawn needs to be mowed and the garage deserves to be cleaned . \",\"We can't go that way , the road is blocked for the next few days . \",\" Oh , that's right . They're filming a movie up there , aren't they ? \",\" Some high speed chase scene , I think . \",\" I wonder how all the businesses in the area feel about that . \",\" I think that they get a pretty good payoff . \",\" The movie company has to pay them ? \",\" I don't know about all of that , but think about it , their business gets free publicity ! \",\" Oh , yeah , they get to be in a movie for the whole world to see ! \",\"May I help you , sir ? \",\" Yes , I have many things to buy . I would like to choose the cleaning milk first . \",\" All right . What is your type of skin ? \",\" Dry . That's my problem . \",\" You can use this . It has special effect for keeping your face moisturized . It has this lotion , as a gift attached . \",\" Sounds good . What about shampoo ? I would like to buy the product that prevents scurf . \",\" How about this one ? It is well-known for the effect of removing scurf . \",\" Is it a newcomer ? \",\" Yes , it is a new brand . \",\" I do not care the brand as long as it works well . \",\" Anything else ? \",\" I want to buy the toothpaste , the brand of Jiajieshi . \",\" Yes , here you are . \",\"Welcome . May I help you ? \",\" Use , I want a eye-shadow . \",\" We have different colours of eye-shadow . May I know what colour you usually wear ? \",\" Purple . But today , I'm thinking of buying one in a bright colour . \",\" Yes , I see . How do you like this one ? \",\" May I have a try ? \",\" Certainly . \",\" It's still too dark . Any brighter colours ? \",\" Not from this brand , I'm afraid . \",\" What about other brands ? \",\" How about this one ? \",\" Oh , that's the very thing I need . \",\"Hey , Mom , look what I found ! \",\" Good heavens ! Don't bring that frog in the house . \",\"Who ate the cookies that were sitting here ? \",\" I did , Mom . \",\" Shame on you . I was saving them for your brother . \",\"Can you tell me what's included in your warranty ? \",\" Certainly . The product has a two-year guarantee . If it breaks down during that period we offer a replacement unit completely free of charge . Our products are very reliable but we recommend you take out an extended warranty . This covers you for a further two years . \",\" I see . What does that include ? \",\" It covers all parts and labour , except for normal wear and tear of course . \",\" What sort of response time do you guarantee ? \",\" Our engineers are on call 24 hours a day . We guarantee someone will be with you within four hours , but in practice it's often much sooner . \",\" Are there any exclusions ? \",\" Not really . It's a very comprehensive warranty . I ' ll put a copy in the post to you and you can read through the small print . \",\"I'm so sorry about your brother , Mr . Wang . \",\" Thanks , Jane . \",\" If you need any help , just let me know . \",\"I need something to wash this down . Is there any juice in the fridge ? \",\" What is that ? It looks like something from a swamp ! \",\" It's a green drink . It's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals . \",\" You know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag . \",\" The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins . \",\" Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ? \",\" It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day . \",\" It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck . \",\"Hey , young lady , get back here and have some breakfast . \",\" Dad ! I don't have time ! I'll be late for school ! \",\" You won't make it through the day without breakfast . \",\" Dad , I never eat breakfast . \",\" Breakfast is brain food . Maybe that's why your grades are Suffering . \",\" Uh ! Dad ! \",\" Don't ' Uh , Dad ' me . Sit down and have some lovely breakfast . \",\" Alright . You win . Please pass the brain food . \",\"What do you think about all the different diets that people go on ? \",\" I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! \",\" But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? \",\" They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . \",\" So you think it's OK for people who are dieting to eat chocolate , don't you ? \",\" Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . \",\" How about drinking soda ? \",\" Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be treated seriously ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . \",\" And have you ever tried taking vitamins ? \",\" I used to take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . \",\" How do you know so much about food and dieting ? \",\" You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size that I am now ! \",\"Would you like to have some icecream ? I've got a variety of flavors for you to choose from . I've got strawberry , peach , chocolate , coffee , vanilla and praline . \",\" Wow ! So many choices you have ! I wish I could , but I just can't . I'm on a diet to lose weight . \",\" Come on , just a bite . It doesn't really hurt to have just a bite . \",\" I'd better not . Please don't tempt me . Please ! \",\" Gee ! You are really strong-willed . \",\" You're damn right . I'm not so easily coaxed into doing something that I think is wrong . \",\" Well , I'd better not tempt you . Otherwise , if I give you a piece of cake , you might ask for a glass of milk . \",\"Can you help me out , Chuck ? \",\" Sure . What's it , Yvonne ? \",\" I want to put my desk over there , but it's too heavy for me to move . \",\" Okay , you take one end and I'll take the other . \",\"It's time to go . Are you ready ? \",\" Almost . Let me get my bag . \",\"How do you put this seat back ? I know there is a lever somewhere . \",\" What are you doing ? \",\" I'm getting dressed , what does it look like ? \",\" It looks like you are about to get dressed . Did you forget we are in a car on the road ? \",\" I'm good at this . Nobody will see anything . \",\" Are you kidding ? You're going to cause an accident just from people gawking ! \",\" All right , pull over at that service station and I'll dress in the ladies ' room . \",\" That will be my pleasure . \",\"Mark , can you dress the twins for me while I take a shower ? \",\" You don't know what you are asking ! \",\" Please ! You can do it . Their clothes are all laid out on the bed . \",\" Remember what happened last time ? \",\" Are you referring to KC getting her head stuck in the pant leg ? \",\" Yes . That was a bit terrifying for both of us . \",\" Don't worry ! Today they are wearing dresses ! \",\" Oh , in that case , sure ! Uh ... what are these long sock-looking things ? \",\"Hello . Welcome ! \",\" Hello . I'd like to have my nails manicured . \",\" This way please . We offer multiple manicure services here . Do you want a full service ? \",\" I don't need the full service . \",\" But the full service will make your nails look much prettier and it is on discount now . \",\" No , thanks . All I need is painting and polishing . \",\" OK . Please sit down . I hope you will be satisfied with our service . \",\" Thanks very much . \",\"You have a lovely house , Jack . \",\" Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately . \",\" That's too bad . What problems are you having . \",\" Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over . \",\" I've studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ? \",\" Go right ahead . \",\" Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room \",\" Wow , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions . \",\" You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help . \",\"Would you like a piece of birthday cake ? \",\" No , thanks , I'll pass . It looks very tempting though . \",\" I thought strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting was your favorite ? \",\" It is . I'm on a diet and strawberry cream cheese cake is not on it . \",\" A diet ? What for ? You are in great shape . \",\" I went to the doctor the other day . My cholesterol is up . \",\" Oooo . This sounds serious . \",\" Not too serious . But he gave me a strict diet to help bring it down . \",\"Are you ready to order yet , sir ? \",\" Yes , I think so . I ' d like to have one medium steak , and a bottle of wine . \",\" Yes , sir . It'll be a moment . \",\" Ok . \",\"Mom , are those tattoos on your brows ? \",\" Uh , yes , they are . \",\" Moooooommmmm ! You're so in ! Anything else you've been keeping from me ? \",\" What ? \",\" Any body piercing ? Stick out your tongue ! \",\" Oh , for Pete's sake . This is cosmetic . My brows are falling out . I did this for convenience . \",\" Come on mom . I'm your A ! Wait till the guys hear about this ! \",\" Mike , don't even think about it ! \",\"Oh , my god ! I look so old . I look as if I were 40 . I think it's time for some plastic surgeries . I'm tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . \",\" I don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You'd better stop being so ridiculous . \",\" Anyway I think I need a nose job and some breast implants as well . \",\" I think you need to get a brain surgery . Honestly speaking , you look charming . \",\" I know what you mean . I just want to make myself more attractive . \",\" You are fine the way you are . Besides , plastic surgery hurts . \",\" Really ? \",\" Sure it is . So you'd better get rid of this idea . \",\"I only want a little off the top and the sides and back to have clean lines . \",\" Okay . Is your hair naturally curly or is it a perm ? \",\" It's natural . My friend told me you know how to work with curls . \",\" That's my specialty . Let me put this around your neck . \",\" Do you have any product that controls frizz ? \",\" With the cut I'll give you , we will minimize a lot of that . \",\" Thank you ! \",\" And when we're done , I'll show you some great stuff to take care of the rest . \",\"What can I do for you ? \",\" I am looking for cologne , small bottle . Can I see that one in the glass shelf ? \",\" Yes , of course , this one costs 260 yuan . \",\" It's too expensive . \",\" If you think it's expensive . You can look at this one . \",\" What's the difference between the two ? \",\" It's difficult to explain . But this one is really cheap . \",\" Let me see . \",\"Excuse me , could you tell me how much is the lipstick ? \",\" It costs only 25 yuan . \",\" Oh , it's too expensive . Can't you make it any cheaper ? \",\" The price is reasonable because the quality is super . \",\" But the price is too high . \",\" How much would you like it to be , then ? \",\" What about 15 yuan ? \",\" Let's meet half way , 20 yuan , OK ? \",\" All right , I'll take it . \",\" I think you've got a real bargain . \",\" Thank you . \",\"Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? \",\" Good morning . I'm interested in antiques . Do you have any ? \",\" Yes , we have a great variety of Chinese antiques . \",\" What do you have ? \",\" Well , we have some painting and some porcelain . Which do you like better ? \",\" I'd like porcelain . \",\" Good . How about the table set ? \",\" Oh , it looks well . I like it very much . \",\" It's made in Jingdezhen . \",\" How much is it ? \",\" One thousand eight hundred yuan . \",\" It's not expensive . I'll take it . \",\"Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ? \",\" Can you show me some traditional Chinese arts and crafts ? \",\" Maybe sandalwood fan is good . \",\" Would you show me some ? \",\" Of course . \",\" They really smell fragrant . How much is a real sandalwood fan ? \",\" The small ones are one hundred yuan for each . And the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan . \",\" I'll take two small ones and a big one . \",\" What else are you interested in ? \",\" I'm afraid not . \",\" OK . Here you are . \",\"I would like to buy some local handcrafts as gifts to my friends and relatives . \",\" There are many stores selling handcrafts in Paris . Our store is wellknown for vase , table wear and jewelry boxes . You can take your time and choose whatever you like . \",\" Well , the tapestry is delicate and beautiful . \",\" You have made an excellent choice , it is our newcomer . The tapestry is on hot sell with the design and quality . The design on it is traditional Paris architecture . \",\" How much is it ? \",\" 100 frances . \",\" Mmm , it is reasonable . Look at this set of table wear , it is so beautiful ! \",\" We have a piece of table clothing to go with it . It is a brocade one with pretty stars . \",\" This silver vase is a good ornament for the living room . \",\" You are right . \",\" I will take the tapestry , the set of table wear and the vase . \",\" OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now . \",\" All right . I will take one . \",\"Did you ever buy food from the snack stands near our hotel ? \",\" Yes , several times . \",\" How do you like them ? \",\" Not bad . \",\" I always have the temptation to eat something there . \",\" Then , why didn't you do that ? \",\" I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ? \",\" Some of them , I think , are not good . \",\" It doesn't taste good ? \",\" No , I mean some of them are not clean enough . \",\" That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ? \",\" I judge by appearances . \",\" I got it . I think it's worth trying . \",\" It certainly is . \",\" I'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things . \",\" Don't try everything at one time , please . \",\" I see . Thank you . \",\"It is my first time coming to China . I want to buy something unique of China to my friends as gifts . \",\" We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ? \",\" Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them . \",\" You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ? \",\" Sounds good . May I have a look ? \",\" Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on . \",\" They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs . \",\" All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality . \",\" Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ? \",\" This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac . \",\" Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones . \",\" OK , I will wrap them for you . \",\"Is there anything I can do for you ? \",\" Would you please show me that mural ? \",\" Certainly . Here you are . \",\" It looks so beautiful . How much is it ? \",\" Four hundred yuan . \",\" That's a bit more than I wanted to pay . Can you cut the price down a bit ? \",\" I'm sorry . Ours is a fixed price shop and I can assure you this is the best price you can get for a mural like this . \",\" Maybe you are right . OK , I'll take it . \",\" Well , I'll have it wrapped for you . \",\" Thank you . Here is four hundred yuan . \",\" Thank you . Please come again . \",\"Mom , is there anything in the fridge I can eat before dinner ? \",\" There's some leftover pizza from last night . \",\" Anything else ? \",\" Um , I think there may be some leftover lasagna from the other day . \",\" Do I have any other choices ? \",\" There might be some birthday cake left in the freezer . \",\" Is everything in the fridge leftovers ? I hate leftovers ! \",\" You can wash the vegetables and cut the chicken and I'll make dinner ! \",\"You are looking really healthy lately . What are you doing differently ? \",\" Thank you for noticing ! I've been making a few lifestyle changes over the past year . \",\" Tell me about it . I'm interested . \",\" Well , it all started when my brother challenged me to quit smoking . \",\" Ha ! That's right . You used to smoke . I forgot ! \",\" When I kicked that habit , I found I had so much more energy . I started exercising . \",\" At the gym ? \",\" No . I like to be outside . I took up hiking and mountain biking . \",\"Yes ! I finally lost that last five pounds I've been working on forever ! \",\" How did you finally do it ? \",\" A friend suggested that I stop nibbling between meals . \",\" Like snacking ? \",\" You know , a little piece of chocolate here , some chips on the side , candy now and then ... \",\" I get what you mean . \",\" Instead , I sit down and have a good snack like a piece of fruit between meals . \",\" I'm impressed . Good for you ! \",\"This book I'm reading about Yoga is really interesting . \",\" I didn't know you did Yoga . \",\" I don't really practice it regularly yet , I'm just learning about it . \",\" What have you learned ? \",\" Right now I'm learning about the importance of breathing slow , deep and regularly . \",\" As opposed to short and shallow ? \",\" Yes . It says here , ' He who only half breathes , half lives . ' \",\" I read something like that once . I think it was , ' Life is in the breath . ' \",\"Good evening , madam . May I help you ? \",\" I want a facial . But this is the first time I've come here , so can you tell me how you do it ? \",\" Sure . Most facials start with a thorough cleaning . Then we usually use a toner to invigorate the skin , followed by exfoliation treatment-a peeling mask or scrub that removes the dead cells that make the skin lock dull . After that , we'll massage your face and neck with oil or cream to improve the circulation and relieve the tension , followed by a mask to moisturize and soften the skin . \",\" That's exactly what I want . How long does it take ? \",\" We have half-hour and one-hour treatments . \",\" What's the regular price ? \",\" Well , the half-hour facial costs 50 yuan and the one-hour costs 80 yuan . If you want make-up , another 20 yuan will do . \",\" Good , I will take the one hour facial with make-up . \",\" That's fine , madam . \",\" By the way , could you give me a manicure ? Use a light nail-polish , please . \",\" Yes , madam . \",\"Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ? \",\" I don't want to . \",\" Well , come over and talk to me then . \",\" Certainly not . \",\" May I turn on the TV then ? \",\" Turn on the TV , for what ? \",\" So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . \",\" Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? \",\" I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner . \",\" To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it . \",\"Where is your dressing room ? \",\" Right over there . \",\" ( Person A comes out of the dressing room ) How did you like the sweater ? \",\" I loved it . I'll take it . \",\" Great . I can ring you up over here . It comes to $ 87.04 . \",\" Here you go ? \",\" Do you have a credit card with us ? \",\" No I don't . \",\" If you open up a card , you can save 10 % on all your purchases today . \",\" Not today . Thanks though . \",\" No problem . We always have this offer , so when ever you decide to , just let us know . \",\" Sure . \",\" Is there anything else I can help you with ? \",\" Yeah . I was looking at some of your pants , but they are all a bit too long . Do you have alteration services here ? \",\" Yes . It cost $ 7 , and it takes one day . \",\" Great . Thanks for your help . \",\" Thank you , and have a great day . \",\"We have reservations for two at your restaurant tonight . \",\" Yes , What can I do for you , sir ? \",\" I'm calling to see if I can request a specific table . \",\" I can try to arrange that for you . \",\" I proposed to my wife in your restaurant and I would like the same table if I can . \",\" Can you describe for me , where you were sitting ? \",\" It was a little table by the bay windows overlooking the wharf . \",\" You're in luck . We still have that little table . \",\"Hi . Can I help you with anything ? \",\" Yeah . Can I look at this ring ? \",\" Sure . Let me get it out for you . What is your size ? \",\" I believe I am a six . \",\" Here you go . \",\" Would you have any necklace that would go well with this ? \",\" Actually , we have a few to choose from . They are over here . \",\" There's no price tag on this necklace . \",\" Oh . I'm sorry . I'll check the price for you . It is $ 199 . \",\" This necklace is a little short . Do you have one that is longer ? \",\" Yes . Why don't you try this one on . \",\" This one is much better . Can I try on the ring with this necklace ? \",\" Sure . Here you go . \",\" Let me think about it . \",\" Sure . Take your time . \",\" Thank you for all the help . \",\" No problem at all . \",\"The portions here are man sized . We usually end up taking half of the meal home with us . \",\" Everything looks so good . Is there anything in particular that you recommend ? \",\" Hey , sis . You know me , if I don't like everything on the menu , I don't go back to the restaurant ! \",\" So you're saying I can't go wrong with anything I order ? In that case ... \",\" Wait , you love salmon , don't you ? They have the best salmon pasta . \",\" That sounds really good ! Does it come with a soup ? \",\" Soup and bread and salad bar ! I'm telling you , these people know how to keep you coming back ! \",\" I see what you mean ! \",\"I've never been to a restaurant like this before . \",\" It's really different , isn't it ? \",\" That's a good word to describe it . \",\" I hope you're hungry because the pizza here is huge as well as to die for . \",\" I am hungry . I think I could eat a large by myself . \",\" Well , let's order one for starters . \",\" I'm in the mood for a Californian . \",\" That happens to be my favorite . Waiter , I think we're ready to order . \",\"Dad , what are we doing tonight for fun ? \",\" We're going over to Mrs . Smith's place to help her with her yard work . \",\" Yard work ? I said ' what are we doing for fun ' , not work ! \",\" It will be fun . And besides , you'll be in the best company . \",\" Dad . You're so cute . What do I need to do to help get ready ? \",\" You could get the rakes and some shovels together and I'll put them in the car . \",\" Jeans and a tee shirt , right ? \",\" Yes and maybe a jacket in case it gets cool . \",\"Ah , here we are . \",\" This is the place I was telling you about . \",\" Would you like to sit near the window ? \",\" Good . \",\" Let's have a look at the menu . Oh , there isn't a menu . Do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ? \",\" Yes , of course . Excuse me . Could you possibly let us see your menu ? Oh . They haven't got one either . \",\"What can I get for you today , sir ? \",\" I would like a cup of decaf with cream and no sugar . \",\" Would you like anything else with that ? \",\" How fresh is that apple pie over there ? \",\" Our pie is brought in fresh every day . And I can tell you it's delicious . \",\" Okay , throw in a piece of that pie then . \",\" Is this to stay or to go ? \",\" I'm in a bit of a hurry today , so we'd better make it to go . Thanks for asking . \",\"Excuse me . Can I ask you a question ? \",\" Sure . What is it ? \",\" I don't know how to say it in English . \",\" We call this a ' parking meter ' . \",\" Oh , Thank you . But how do you spell it ? \",\" P-a-r-k-i-n-g m-e-t-e-r . \",\"Would you mind giving me a hand ? \",\" Okay , Bob , What is it ? \",\" Help me hang up this picture , please . Would you hold it straight while I put in the nail ? \",\" All right . \",\" Now , hand me the hammer and those nails , please . \",\" Yes , here you are . \",\" There ! How does it look ? Tell me if I've got it straight . \",\" Well , it's straight , but it's upside down I'm afraid . \",\"Mom , I want to get a motorcycle . Is that all right with you ? \",\" You mean a murder cycle ? Did you know more cyclists die in accidents than motorists ? \",\" Mom ! I'll wear a helmet and I'll drive sane . I promise . \",\" I'll tell you what . You can get a motorcycle on one condition . \",\" What's that ? \",\" You spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an EMT trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month . \",\" And after that ? \",\" After that , we'll let you decide if you still want a murder , I mean motorcycle . \",\"Did you hear about that accident on the 5 ? There was a sixty-two-car pile up . \",\" No kidding ! When did that happen ? \",\" Early this morning . \",\" Oh , no . \",\" Yeah . And a semi jack-knifed trying to miss a stalled car in the fast lane . You can imagine what happened after that . \",\" Sixty two cars . Oath . Do they know how many casualties yet ? \",\" The count is up to seven right now and several are in critical condition . \",\" That's amazingly low for such a huge accident ! \",\"Honey , I think I need to go see the doctor . \",\" Ah ! You're bleeding all over ! What happened ? \",\" I was working in the garage and cut myself with my saw . \",\" Here , use this rag to apply pressure to the cut . Does it hurt ? \",\" No , not really , there's just a lot of blood . \",\" You may just need stitches . I think they can handle this at the clinic instead of the ER . Let me make a quick phone call . \",\" I'm going to go sit in the car while I still have the stomach to walk . \",\" Oh , sorry ! I forgot you get queasy with the sight of blood . I'll be right there . \",\"This is 911 . \",\" Send an ambulance fast ! My husband is having a heart attack ! \",\" Slow down and tell me your address . \",\" I live on 1177 Oak lane in Smithfield . Oh , hurry , I don't know what to do ! \",\" An ambulance is on its way right now . They should be there any minute . Are you close to him right now ? \",\" yes , yes , he's right here by me . \",\" Is he breathing ? \",\" Yes , he's breathing , but he's not conscious ! Oh , please hurry ! \",\"Bob , would you come and help me ? \",\" Of course . What do you want me to do , Mom ? \",\" Could you hold these packages while I look for the key ? \",\" Alright , what's in them ? They are so heavy ! \",\" Just things we need for the picnic tomorrow . \",\" Well , hurry up and open the door please . I told you these things are heavy . \",\" I'm sorry , but I just can't find the key . You must have it . \",\" Oh , yes , it's in my pocket . But how can I get the key while I'm holding all these bags ? \",\"Hello , Miao Li , Where are you going ? \",\" Hello , I am going to the store to buy some fruit . \",\" Oh , Would you do me a favor ? \",\" Yes ? \",\" Please mail this letter for me on your way to the store . \",\" Sure . Do you want it to be registered ? \",\" Yes , I think so . There are some pictures in it . It would be a great pity if they were lost . \",\" Yes , I will be glad to mail your letter . \",\" Thanks . \",\" you are welcome . \",\"Good afternoon . \",\" Good afternoon . Can I help you ? \",\" I've got this important letter to send to Hainan . Can I send it by registered mail ? \",\" Certainly . \",\" How much will I have to pay ? \",\" Two yuan , please . \",\" Here are the letter and the money . \",\" Wait a moment . It seems that your letter is overweight . Let me weight it . \",\" Is it overweight ? \",\" I'm afraid it is . So you will have to pay two yuan extra . The total charge is four yuan . \",\" All right . Here is the money . \",\" Here are the stamps and your receipt . \",\" What shall I do with the receipt ? \",\" You can keep it until the addressee tells you that the letter has been delivered . It is the proof that you sent the letter if it fails to arrive . \",\" Thank you . \",\" Not at all . \",\"Can I help you , Miss ? \",\" Do you have anything which can prevent wrinkles and freckles ? \",\" What is your skin type ? \",\" My skin is kind of oily . \",\" This nutrition cream is for anti-wrinkling and whitening which is a newcomer brand . \",\" How much is it ? \",\" $ 60.The price is reasonable for its large quantity . What's more , there are some gifts attaching for you . \",\" Sounds good . What are the gifts attaching ? \",\" You can take one tonic or hand cream . \",\" I will choose the tonic . \",\" No problem . You can try this kind of gel which can prevent freckle , the effect will be better if you use this powder foundation applied with it . \",\" That's the very thing I want . \",\"Excuse me . Can you show me some nail-polish ? \",\" Yes . We have all kinds of colors for it . \",\" That's good . \",\" What's your favorite color ? \",\" In my opinion , orange is very nice . \",\" Sometimes pink is not bad , too . \",\" You're right . Well , just these two , please . \",\" Thank you . Anything else ? \",\" No , thanks . \",\"I can't believe the way our landlord cheated us . \",\" I know how you feel . I had a similar problem with a landlord a few years ago . Fortunately , the one we have now is very nice . \",\"Yes , sir ? \",\" Could we have the bill , please ? \",\" That's 68 pounds altogether , please . \",\" That's alright . Here you are . \",\"Be careful . The floor is wet . \",\" What happened ? \",\" I spilled my drink . \",\"Can you give me a hand , Tom ? \",\" Sure . \",\" Can you open this bottle for me ? The cork seems to be stuck . \",\" I'll have a go . \",\"Don't tell me that's your lunch ? \",\" No , this is just my appetizer ... this is my lunch ! \",\" A candy bar for an appetizer and a piece of pie for lunch ! That's all junk ! \",\" This is good food , it has milk , fruit , grains , nuts ... \",\" Sugar , sugar , preservatives , fats , more sugar , more fat , more preservatives ! \",\" At least I enjoy my lunch ! What's in your bag ? \",\" My wife sent me with rice , vegetables , and some curry chicken . \",\" There's the difference , your wife made it ! I have to make my own lunch ! \",\"Can you shorten this pipe for me ? It's too long . \",\" Sure . I'll do it after lunch . What length do you need ? \",\" Can you take 15 mm of it ? \",\" Yes , no problem . It'll be ready by 2 p . m . \",\"Mom , what were movies like when you were a kid ? \",\" Everything about them was different , even the theaters . \",\" I'm really interested . Tell me about them . \",\" Well , where I grew up , we saw movies at a drive-in theater in our car with the whole family . \",\" That's cool . I bet you could bring your own food . \",\" We did . On hot days , we'd take a blanket and lay in the back of dad's old pickup to watch the movie . \",\" Why don't we do that anymore ? \",\" Well , the weather might have some influence , during bad weather the theater didn't make a whole lot . \",\"Do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for ? \",\" Yes , G stands for General Audiences , PG means Parental Guidance suggested , R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content . \",\" Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ? \",\" Remember when we were kids ? Theaters wouldn't let kids in to PG moves without a parent . \",\" I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed . \",\" Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter . \",\" Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either . \",\" Now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't . \",\"( A stranger stops to help ) Everything OK ? \",\" No ! My tour bus got a speeding ticket not ten minutes ago . Now my engine is on fire ! \",\" I think that's just steam . Your engine's overheated . \",\" Do you know a lot about cars ? \",\" A little bit . I'll take a look if you want me to . \",\" Please . Thank you so much for stopping . \",\" Yeah , she's hot . Radiator's leaking . Looks like you were running her pretty hard . \",\" That must have been just before I got the speeding ticket . \",\" Did you have an accident recently ... Hey , wait a second ! I know this car ! \",\" You do ? \",\" I ran into it a couple of weeks ago . What do you know ? Name's Hal . \",\" I'm Akimbo . Nice to meet you , I guess . \",\" Boy , I'm sure sorry about your car . Hey , Akimbo , I wonder if you'd like to make a deal ? \",\" What kind of deal ? \",\" I'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car . \",\" You don't want your insurance company to pay for it ? \",\" I'd rather not . They'll raise my rates . It'll cost me more in the long run . \",\" If you give me cash , do you care if I don't fix the car ? \",\" Hell , I don't care . Just don'T submit a report to your insurancecompany . \",\" It's a deal , Hal . Thanks again for stopping to help . And thanks for smashing my car ! \",\"Who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone ? \",\" I did . Why ? \",\" Didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ? \",\" No , I didn't . I'm sorry . It won't happen again . \",\"I'm going crazy . \",\" What's the matter ? \",\" I've got a dozen things to do and they all have to be done immediately . \",\" Well , if there is anything I can do to help , let me know . \",\"Is there anything I can do for you ? \",\" I'm trying to choose a gift . \",\" Did you have anything particular in mind ? \",\" No , but I'd like to get something typical in this region . \",\" Well , we have some handmade products . Let me show you some . \",\" They're quite nice . But I'm afraid they're quite a bit expensive . \",\" About how much were you planning to spend ? \",\" No more than one hundred yuan . \",\" Oh , in that case . This one is OK . \",\" Oh ! It's perfect . I think I'll take it . Would you wrap it , please ? \",\" OK . Wait for a moment , please . \",\"This is the house I want to rent . \",\" Could you tell me the advantages of it ? \",\" No problem . First , it's comfortable and cozy . Second , it has a lovely view of the city . Third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient . \",\" There is something in what you said , but what is the rent ? \",\" 200 dollars per week . \",\" In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas . \",\" It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent . \",\" Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself . \",\" Don't you think I can save some bus fares since it ' s easy to go anywhere from here and it ' s near the place where I work ? \",\" I agree with you in this way . But how often do you go to work or shopping per week ? \",\" Twice a week for work and once for shopping . \",\" In my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university . \",\" That's true . Ok , I will think about it . \",\"Chinese tea is famous all over the world . I want to buy several boxes . \",\" There are various kinds of tea in China . It depends on the taste and effect . \",\" Well , I do not know Chinese tea at all . \",\" This is green tea , you can drink it in summer . It can relieve summer-heat and it is good for maintaining your lungs . \",\" Sounds interesting . What about this ? \",\" It is black tea , it has a strong taste and promotes digestion . \",\" What's this ? It smells fragrant . \",\" It is jasmine tea of high quality . It is fragrant and has a pleasant taste . \",\" I will take the jasmine tea . Could you pack it with the wrapping paper and ribbon ? It is a gift for my friend . \",\" No problem . Wait for a moment . \",\"Can I help you ? \",\" I'd like to buy some Chinese-style cakes . Could you recommend me some ? \",\" Certainly . What about moon cake ? It's typical Chinese food . \",\" Moon cakes ? What is that ? \",\" The moon cake is round and looks like the full moon . That's why it's called the moon cake and the moon cake symbolizes family reunion and harmony . \",\" Sounds very interesting . I'll buy some to family people . \",\" All the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles , Cantonese style and Suzhou style . \",\" What's the difference between these two styles ? \",\" The skin of Cantonese style cakes is soft and puffy with heavy stuffing while the skin of Suzhou style cakes is puffy filled with fragrant nuts . \",\" Get me some of each . \",\" OK , here you are . \",\"Why is there water all over the bathroom floor ? \",\" I'm sorry - it's my fault . I was filling the bathtub and I left the water running too long , so it overflowed . \",\" That's OK . As long as you clean it up . \",\"Excuse me , I have something to trouble you . \",\" Yes ? I'll be very glad if I could be of any help to you . \",\" An hour ago , I bought this vase with my tourist . \",\" Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ? \",\" I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel . \",\" Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ? \",\" Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes . \",\" It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ? \",\" All right . Thank you . \",\" Just a minute , please . I won't be long . I'm sure this one is perfect . You may examine it carefully . \",\" Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one . \",\" I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you . \",\" Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing . \",\"Ann , it's terrible ! \",\" What's up ? \",\" Look , this is a pimple ! \",\" Oh , I think it is . \",\" How come ? \",\" I think it's because of your bad habits ! \",\" I have no bad habit . I sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . I have done a lot . \",\" I know you have done a lot , but you always sleep very late . Sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy . Sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body , and I think this is your problem . \",\" I wasn't aware of that ! \",\" You should do better later . \",\"Hello ? Can you give me a tow ? My tour car's stranded . \",\" Sure . Where are you ? \",\" I'm on highway 1-75 going near exit 46 . \",\" What kind of car ? \",\" It's a blue Nissan minivan . \",\" Where are you going to ? \",\" The closest garage . What's the charge ? \",\" You are within 50 kilometers , so it's a 50 - dollar flat rate . \",\" How long will it take ? \",\" About 20 to 30 minutes . \",\" Thanks . \",\"How's your new car ? \",\" Perfect ! Couldn't be better . \",\" You made a good choice , then ? \",\" It's just what I want . \",\" No regrets ? \",\" I am really pleased with it . \",\" I am glad you are happy . \",\" It's super . \",\"Would you like to see our new shirts ? \",\" Sorry , but I'm not really that interested in those things . \",\" Well , they are very nice you know . \",\" Really ? \",\" And not expensive either . \",\" Oh , I don't care about that . \",\" Everybody is buying them . \",\" Are they ? \",\" Yes , they are very fashionable , you see . \",\" I am afraid I am not interested in fashion . \",\" I see . \",\" But thank you very much all the same . \",\" Sorry I couldn't help you . \",\"Tommy played truant today . His teacher called me this morning . \",\" Where did he go ? \",\" I've asked him , but he won't tell me . What should we do about this ? He is like you . I remember when we were at the college , you always skipped classes . \",\" Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future . \",\" Stop , stop ... We are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . Maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school . \",\" Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . \",\" In that way , I'll be late every day . How about letting him go to school on school bus ? \",\" That's a good idea . Why have I never thought of that ? \",\" That's because I went to school for each class when I was at school . So now I am much more clever than you . \",\"What is this big box at the front door ? \",\" Oh . I don't know what to do . I joined this club a long time ago and I didn't read the fine print . \",\" What did you get yourself into ? \",\" I didn't realize that I have to buy something from them every six months . \",\" So , what's in the box ? A fridge ? \",\" It's a curio cabinet . The only thing is I don't even own those kinds of little keepsakes . \",\" I guess you'll read the fine print next time , won't you ! \",\" Don't rub it in . Where am I going to put this huge thing ? \",\"What's up ? You sound a little down in dumps . \",\" I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn . \",\" Calm down ! Shouting won ' t help ? \",\" He is really outrageous . \",\" What happened ? \",\" I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me . \",\" What ? He can't do this to you . \",\" Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know . \",\" What did you do ? \",\" I shouted it back of course . \",\" Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ? \",\" What would you do if you were in my shoes ? \",\" Just stay cool . You know . When you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him . \",\" No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault . \",\" I know . It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate . \",\" I am too angry to do that . \",\"How can I help you ? \",\" I'd like to buy some perfume for my girlfriend . \",\" Do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ? \",\" She usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of Chanel No . 5 . But I'd like to buy her a new Fragrance . \",\" OK , here are some of our most popular perfumes . \",\" Which one would you recommend ? \",\" Personally , I quite like the new perfume from Clinique . It's a subtle flowery scent . What do you think ? \",\" That smells great . I'll take one bottle , please . \",\" Would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers . \",\" It's OK . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I don't know what shade to buy . \",\" How about some lipstick ? Every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick . \",\" She doesn't usually wear lipstick . She thinks it makes her nose look too big . \",\" How about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger . \",\" No , thank you . She has big enough eyes as it is . \",\" I know what she would like-some whitening cream . \",\" No thanks . Western women usually try to make their skin darker , not lighter . \",\" Will that be all then ? \",\" That will be all . You've been very helpful , thanks . \",\"Good morning , madam . Can I help you ? \",\" I want to buy some cleansing milk . What would you recommend ? \",\" Your complexion is on the oily side . I suggest you use cleansing gel . \",\" Anything that can keep my skin clean will do . \",\" How do you prefer this one ? It cleans thoroughly without striping your natural protective oil . The gentle formula keeps skin soft and healthy . \",\" Hm ... the smell is too strong , I can't stand it . I'm very sensitive to fragrance . \",\" We've also got a fragrance-free one , specially designed for sensitive skin . I'm sure you'll like it . \",\" I'll try that . Do you have facial cream to go with that ? \",\" Yes , sure . This line of products is fragrance-free . We have a facial mask , moisturizing lotion , eye cream and tonic . \",\" I'll buy the moisturizing lotion and cleansing gel first . If they suit me , I'll come back for the others later . \",\" Thank you very much , madam . Here are some samples of our products . Do try them out . \",\"What did you buy at the market ? \",\" I bought some special local products . \",\" You seem to have bought the whole market ! \",\" Yes . I really wanted to do so . I love those handicrafts , especially the paper-cut . \",\" Paper-cuts are all hand-made . Let me see the paper-cuts you bought . They are all animals . \",\" Aren't animals the main content of Chinese paper-cuts ? \",\" All right . Animals , especially Chinese zodiac , are the most common theme in paper-cuts . But there are other themes . \",\" Then I will buy some tomorrow . \",\" Why do you want to buy so much ? \",\" Because I want to send them to my friends . \",\" I see . \",\"Are there pets allowed in this apartment ? \",\" No dogs or cats or any other fur type animal , but other pets are allowed . \",\" What about a boa constrictor ? \",\" Well . . . is that a pet ? Isn't that something from the zoo ? \",\" If I had one , could I rent this apartment ? \",\" I was more thinking of nice little fish or frogs or turtles or a pet rock . \",\" What about a Gila monster ? \",\" I'll tell you what , if your pet can fit in this little box and doesn't have fur , it is welcome here . \",\"Dad , can I have a pet ? I did what you said and passed all of my exams . \",\" Then I guess you get to have a pet . Do you know what you want ? \",\" I want a dog . My friend Mindy's dog just had puppies and she said I can have one . \",\" You know who will be responsible for feeding and cleaning and all of that stuff ? \",\" I know , I know . I will do it all by myself . \",\" Have you figured out the costs involved with feeding and caring for it ? \",\" Yes . It will cost me about $ 50 a month . And I make a little more than that already . \",\" Sounds like you've done your homework . I think you're ready for this . \",\"Beth , would you like me to help you carry it ? \",\" Thanks , but I don't want to put you into any trouble . \",\" Don't be silly . It's no trouble at all . \",\"I think this painting would look good in our living room . What do you think ? \",\" Sure . Let's buy it . \",\"Help ! I'm about to drop these books . \",\" I've got them . \",\" Thanks ! \",\"What can I do for you ? \",\" I'd like to buy a keepsake for my girlfriend . Could you make a recommendation for me ? \",\" I'd like to . How do you like the hat ? \",\" It's not special . It can be seen everywhere . \",\" How about the umbrella ? It's made of wood and paper . It's very beautiful . \",\" It's interesting . Let me see . \",\" Do you like it ? \",\" Yes , how much is it ? \",\" Fifty yuan . \",\" OK , I'll take it . \",\"Where are you going , Tony ? \",\" It's none of your business . \",\" Mom said you couldn't go out . \",\" I'm going out anyway . Get out of my way . \",\"Has someone already helped you ? \",\" No , not yet . I'd like to buy a teapot . \",\" Which do you like best ? \",\" That colored one is very beautiful . It may suit my furniture . How much do you ask for it ? \",\" 360 yuan . \",\" Show it to me , Please . Can you get me another ? It's scratched a little bit here . \",\" Sorry , sir . This is the last one we have in stock . \",\" I do like it . Can you come down a bit ? \",\" I can give you a 10 % discount . \",\" That's still too much . Can you lower the price further ? \",\" I'm afraid that's the best we can do . \",\" If so , I'd better try another store . \",\"So how far is the museum , dad ? \",\" It is about 10 minutes walk . \",\" Finish your hot chocolate and we will go . \",\" Are we going to come back here for lunch ? \",\" No , we will have lunch at the museum cafeteria . \",\" I have finished . We can go now . \",\" Let's go then . On the way we have to turn right and right again at the next junction . \",\" Let's stop at the newsagent , I would like to buy a newspaper . We can also buy postcards for your friends . \",\" Can you see a Post Office somewhere around here ? \",\" Yes it is down there , at the end of the road , next to the supermarket . \",\" Oh good we are almost there . The museum is round the corner from the Post Office . \",\"I need some flowers for my girlfriend . \",\" No problem . Would you like some artificial carnations ? \",\" Oh , no . Carnations are not very elegant . Artificial flowers have no passion . \",\" How much did you want to spend ? \",\" Money is no object . \",\" Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily . \",\" I will take ten . \",\" Do you want to add some baby's breath for that ? They are equally popular now . \",\" Of course . Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ? \",\" Yes , but there is a five dollars delivery charge . \",\" That's ok . Here is the address . \",\"What can I do for you ? \",\" Can I have a look at your handworks ? \",\" All right . This way , please . \",\" You have quite a range , haven't you ? \",\" Yes , sir . \",\" They are all produced in China , aren't they ? \",\" Yes , they are all distinctive Chinese . \",\" Could you please select me one ? \",\" How do you like this one ? It's very beautiful . \",\" Oh , I like it very much . How much does it cost ? \",\" 350 yuan . \",\" OK . I'll take it . \",\"Dad , do you know where Mom is ? \",\" I think she is in her room putting a little something together for you to take to school with you . \",\" She'd better not start crying like she usually does . \",\" I know , but she is going to miss you something awful . Have I told you how proud I am of you ? \",\" Dad , now don't you go getting mush on me . \",\" I mean it . You have really shown us that you are prepared to take on the adult world . \",\" That means a lot to me Dad . Thanks . \",\" We have great confidence in you . \",\"Mom , look ! My first piggy bank and it still has money in it ! \",\" That is a blast from the past . \",\" Remember when I used to beg you to break it so I could go buy ice cream ? \",\" Yes . You sure have come a long way in valuing your hard earned dollars . \",\" Thanks for not giving in to my childhood tantrums , mom . \",\" But what are you going to do with that pig ? \",\" I think I'm going to keep it as a monument to what I've learned about money . \",\" Who knows , maybe one day he will sit on the desk of a top CEO in a major corporation ! \",\"Tomorrow I will be the new owner of all dad's assets . \",\" It still feels really strange to me . \",\" I know . I miss him terribly . \",\" How does it feel to be in charge of so much money ? \",\" I thought I would feel like I was in the lap of Luxury . \",\" I guess you could choose that if you wanted . \",\" No , I think I will run things much the same way that Dad did . \",\" Dad really knew what he was doing when he chose you to take over for him when he was gone ! \",\"Do I have to deposit my handbag at the checkroom ? \",\" No , you do not have to . The handbag can be taken with you . There is the cart at the entrance . \",\" Thank you . I'd tike to buy some milk powder for my baby . Is there anything that you can recommend for me ? \",\" Well , how old is your baby ? \",\" No more than three . \",\" The milk powder on the second level of the shelf is for the kids from 2 ages to 4 ages . I advice that you should buy the Wyeth brand , the source of milk is imported from New Zealand . \",\" How about its quality ? \",\" You can be assured of it . There are various nutritions which are beneficial for the growth of babies ' bone and cerebrum . \",\" OK , what is this ? \",\" It is feeding-bottle as the free gift . \",\" It is thoughtful . I will take it . \",\"We will go to climb up the hill tomorrow . Let's go to supermarket to buy some food . \",\" Yes , we can have a picnic on the top of the hill . \",\" What should we buy ? \",\" Let me see . We should go to buy some fruit first . \",\" It is heavy and not convenient to take them to the top . \",\" How about taking a cantaloupe ? It is light and sweet . Children love it . \",\" Good idea . We can buy some candy and nuts for children . \",\" Yes . Look , cashew , peanuts , assorted biscuits , chocolate , canned goods , anything else ? \",\" That's enough for the kids . Get some drinks . \",\" Definitely beer . Two bottles . \",\" Right . We should buy some yoghurt for kids . \",\" Yes . Shall we buy some saucers ? It will be used during our picnic . \",\" OK . Four saucers . We can buy some custard tarts tomorrow morning . \",\" Let's go to queue up . There are so many people in the lines . \",\"Can I help you ? \",\" I need some stamps . \",\" What kind of stamps do you want ? \",\" How much do I need for this letter ? \",\" I must weigh it . \",\" How much ? Is it overweight ? \",\" It is 5 grams overweight . Do you want to send it as an ordinary or registered letter ? \",\" How much is it , then ? \",\" Registration plus overweight , 7 yuan in all . \",\" OK . Here you are . \",\"Hi Barbara . Have you lost weight ? \",\" Hi Julie . Yeah . I've been on a diet for a couple of months now . \",\" Wow . You look great . \",\" Thanks for noticing . \",\" What type of diet were you on ? \",\" I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising , I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months . \",\" That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ? \",\" Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day . \",\" That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ? \",\" Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate . \",\" That makes sense . I'm going to try that . \",\" You don't need to lose weight . \",\" I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of . \",\" Ah ... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet . \",\" Thanks for the advice . \",\" No problem . \",\"Nancy , please turn the TV down . \",\" Come on , John . This is my favorite show . \",\" I don't care . I have a headache . \",\"I'm sleepy . I can hardly keep my eyes open . \",\" Why don't you go to bed ? \",\" I think I will . \",\"Nathan said he didn't have any fun at his new school this week . Do you know why ? \",\" I think he hasn't made any new friends yet . He's just a little lonely . \",\" He really misses his friends from our old neighborhood . \",\" Without a doubt . Maybe if he knew he doesn't have to give up any of his old friends to make new ones , it will be easier for him . \",\" How do you propose to help him understand that ? \",\" Well , we can help him keep in touch with his old friends . \",\" I guess we could go visit once in a while too . \",\" Yeah . There's a lot we can do to help him through this transition . \",\"Oops ! \",\" What happened ? \",\" I overcooked the corn . \",\" That's okay . I like it better that way anyway . \",\"I'm freezing . Turn down the air conditioner , will you ? \",\" But then it'll be too warm . \",\" Not if you take off your jacket . \",\"Hi , I'm home ! Can you double that recipe ? I ran into an old friend after work and invited him for dinner . \",\" No problem . Who is it ? Anyone I know ? \",\" I don't think so . Do you remember Bob Gain from Tulsa ? \",\" That name doesn't ring a bell . But tell me more . \",\" He was on the diving team with me in high school and saved my life one day . \",\" Well , I'll have to personally thank him by making him my famous chocolate cake . \",\" You're glad he saved me , huh ? \",\" Absolutely ! Bob and his whole family are welcome here any time ! \",\"Can you believe her ? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet . \",\" Tell me about it . If I was as small as her , I wouldn't think about going on a diet . \",\" Me too . But what are we going to do ? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight . \",\" That's because you don't exercise . If you were more active , you wouldn't have a dieting problem . \",\" What do you know ? You are over weight too . \",\" I'm not on a diet though . \",\" I know . But I don't have someone to diet with . If we help each other and motivate each other , then I think we can lose some weight . \",\" I like ice cream too much though . \",\" C'mon . You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there . \",\" It does sound appealing . \",\" It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed . \",\" Okay . I'm in . Let's do it . \",\" Great . I'll get our plan started right away . \",\" Can we start tomorrow though ? \",\"I need to buy some fruit . \",\" All the fruit are pretty fresh here . \",\" How much are the pears ? \",\" They're four yuan per kilo . \",\" Give me one kilo of those , please . Do you have any fresh plums ? \",\" Yes , we do . They are eight yuan per kilo . \",\" It's a bit too expensive . We can get it for six yuan in the shop next here . \",\" Take much and you can have them six yuan per kilo . \",\" Sounds reasonable . I'll take three kilos . \",\" OK . It's 22 yuan \",\" Here you are . \",\"I'm sorry to interrupt you . Please take care not to make a mess while you are selecting goods . If you don't want it , please replace it . \",\" Oh , I'm terribly sorry . but I couldn't find the yoghurt I saw here last time . \",\" What's the brand ? \",\" San Yuan . \",\" Oh , it's out of stock at the moment . Why don't you choose another brand instead ? \",\" I'm not used to other brands . \",\" You can have a try . Maybe you will like it . \",\" OK . I hope so . \",\"Good afternoon , sir . Gan I help you ? \",\" Good afternoon , I want to pick up a new shaver since the old one has retired . \",\" Which brand are you interested in ? \",\" I'm still not sure . The type with top quality , I guess . Well , which one do you recommend ? \",\" Do you prefer imported ones or domestic ones ? \",\" It doesn't matter much . If it has high quality and reasonable price , it will be OK . \",\" How about Flymo ? It's selling well . \",\" Do you have a warranty on it ? \",\" Of course . The warranty period is one year . \",\" If there's something wrong with it in a week , can I come back to change it ? \",\" Sure . But you must show us the receipt . If something comes up , we'll change it for you . \",\" OK . I'll take one . \",\"Lucy , where are you going ? \",\" I want to go to the supermarket . \",\" Wait a few minutes and I'll go there with you . \",\" Let's get a shopping cart . \",\" Good idea \",\" What are you going to buy ? \",\" Let's check out the fruit section first . \",\" OK . I'd like some oranges . But they don't look quite ripe yet . \",\" Look , nice fresh cherries ! They are ripe and soft . I'll take some . \",\" I'll take some , too . \",\" Let's go to the snacks section . I want some chocolate and sweets . \",\" OK . I'll go and buy some cakes . \",\" Do you want to buy something else ? \",\" No . Let's go over to the check-out stand . \",\"Mom , I finished . \",\" OK . Could you please help me to clean them ? \",\" Of course . \",\" Great . At first , you can put the chairs back . \",\" OK . Now I'll put the dishes in the sink . \",\" Thank you . I'll wash them . \",\" OK . Then I will clean the table . \",\" Good boy . \",\"I had a busy morning . \",\" What did you do ? \",\" I watered all the plants . \",\" You have a lot of plants . \",\" Then I did my laundry . \",\" That takes some time . \",\" I took the dog for a walk . \",\" I'll bet he enjoyed his walk . \",\" I vacuumed the entire house . \",\" That's a lot of work . \",\" And then I made lunch . \",\" I'll bet you were hungry ! \",\"My mom and dad insist that I be home before ten . Do you have a curfew ? \",\" Yes . I've had one for as long as I can remember . \",\" I wish my parents were a little more lenient . \",\" I actually like having a curfew . I have an excuse to get to bed on time . \",\" You like going to bed early ? \",\" I don't like being too tired the next day . \",\" Well , I still hate having a curfew . \",\" If you stayed up much later , you would see that just about every-thing closes around ten anyway . \",\"I found a great school for Junior ! \",\" Don't you think it's a little early to be looking for schools ? We haven't even had the baby yet ! \",\" We can't be too cautious about these things . \",\" You are going to be such an adorable father ! Tell me about this school . \",\" There is a huge slide on the playground and lots of trees and even a little brook ! \",\" What about inside the school ? \",\" There is a library right inside the front door . \",\" I think our child is going to love it ! \",\"What do you think about half day kindergarten for Stacey ? \",\" We could try it for the first few weeks and see if she likes it . \",\" I just think it will be a little difficult for her to be away from home for so long right off the bat . \",\" You have a good point . She hasn't really ever been away from home for longer than a few hours . \",\" I think she is really going to like her teacher though . \",\" Yes , they seemed to click at the meeting the other day . \",\" Did you happen to notice if she was interested in any of the other kids ? \",\" No , but I did notice that she was very interested in the art supplies ! \",\"Tom , it's time for you to take a shower . \",\" Mom , I don't want to bathe today . \",\" Why ? You can't be always so lazy . \",\" Mom , I'm tired . I feel sleepy . I want to go to bed right now . \",\" Alright . But you promise this is the last time . \",\" OK . I promise . Thank you , Mom . \",\"Mom , will you tuck me in tonight ? \",\" Sure , honey . I'll read you a bed time story , too . \",\" I hope I don't have any nightmares tonight . \",\" Don't worry , you'll sleep well tonight . \",\" Thanks for tucking me , Mom . \",\"Peter , it's time to get up . \",\" Ten more minutes , mom . \",\" What time is it now ? \",\" It's already 3 8 o'clock . \",\" Well , honey , wake up , or you'll be late for school . \",\"Peter , take off your pajamas . \",\" What should I wear today ? \",\" It's chilly outside , so don't forget to put on your jacket . \",\" How's the shirt ? \",\" Son , it looks great on you . \",\"Good morning , madam . What can I do for you ? \",\" I want some coffee . \",\" Certainly , madam . What kind of coffee do you want to have ? \",\" What have you got ? \",\" Well . We have espresso , latte , skinny latte , fancy coffee and Americano . \",\" I think I'll have a latte , please . \",\" OK . Wait a minute , please . And the sugar is right over there . \",\"Can I help you , sir ? \",\" I'd like a table for two , please . \",\" Do you have a reservation , sir ? \",\" No , I'm afraid not . Can I sit over there ? There's a table free by the window . \",\" Sorry , sir . That table has been reserved . This way , please . How about this one , sir ? \",\" Fine . I'll sit here . \",\" Would you like some drinks ? \",\" I'll have a double whiskey on the rocks . \",\"Hi ! Fiona ? I almost didn't recognize you . You are much thinner since I last saw you . \",\" Yes . I have lost about ten kilos . \",\" How did you do it ? \",\" I am on a diet . And I do more exercise regularly . \",\" What's the secret then ? \",\" It lies in perseverance . \",\" Well . It's hard for me . I can't keep doing exercise . \",\" You should have a try . \",\"Excuse me . I want to pay for these items . \",\" OK . This way , please . \",\" How much is it all together ? \",\" Let me see . 100 dollars . \",\" Can I pay by credit card ? \",\" Sorry . You can only pay in cash . \",\" OK . Here you are . \",\" Thank you . Do you need the invoice ? \",\" Yes . And can you pack the things up , please ? \",\" Sure . I'll get right on it . \",\"What can I do for you ? \",\" I want to get a package of cigarette . \",\" Have you a taste for this kind ? \",\" No , this kind of cigarette is too strong for me , I desire a mild one . \",\" What about this ? \",\" It suits my taste , I'll take it . Do you have lighters ? \",\" I have a lot of them . \",\" Show me the one made of plastic . \",\" OK , here you are . \",\" Thank you . \",\"Can I help you , sir ? \",\" I wish to buy a diamond ring . \",\" How many carats would you like it to be ? \",\" I want five carats . \",\" Is this one suitable for you ? \",\" No , it seems too old-fashioned to my fiancee . \",\" What about this ? \",\" It seems too small for me , haven't you got any larger ones ? \",\" Then you can buy this one . It's very nice and latest in style . \",\" Oh , this one is perfect . \",\"Is Bob home ? \",\" Hold on \",\"Hello ! \",\" Hello , Is that Stefan ? \",\" I'm sorry , but I'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number.There is no Stefan here . \",\" Really ? Are you sure ? I called before and he was there . \",\" Yes . I'm sure . You have the wrong number . I have used this number for more than 20 years . \",\" That can't be true . I remember the number clearly . Is your number 1199886 ? \",\" No , it isn't . It's 1199866 . It seems that you have misdialed . \",\" Oh , I'm sorry I bothered you . I'm really sorry . \",\" It doesn't matter . It happens to everyone . \",\" Sorry again for bothering you . \",\" That's all right . \",\"Hello , Can I speak to Tom , please ? \",\" I'm afraid he is not in at the moment . \",\" May I ask what time he will come back ? \",\" I think he will come back at 3 p . m . Do you want to call later ? Or would you like to leave a message for him ? \",\" I'd like to leave a message . Please ask him to call me back as soon as he returns . I'm A and he has my number . \",\" OK . I will do that . \",\" Thank you very much . Bye . \",\" You're welcome . Bye . \",\"Hello ! \",\" Is that Sue ? \",\" Speaking . \",\" A.This is George . \",\" Hello , George.What ' s up ? \",\"Good morning , mom . \",\" Good morning , sweetie .

I'll check the heater . Dry yourself with the towel first . \",\"Mom , I'm ready for school . \",\" Don't forger to come straight home after school . \",\" I know , mom . \",\" Have you got everything ? \",\" Oh , my jump rope .

Let me try it . \",\" Here you are , sir . \",\" Thank you . \",\"How was school today ? \",\" It was great . I made some friends . \",\" Really , that's good . \",\" But the lessons this semester are a little bit hard . \",\" They aren't hard . I am sure you can do it . \",\"Oh , dear ! which dress should I choose ? I can't make up my mind . Please help me . \",\" You know I don't know anything about fashion . \",\" Which dress do you like best ? \",\" Well , they are both all right . \",\" Only all right ? \",\" Oh , no . I mean you look very nice in both of them . \",\" Mike , that's no help to me at all . I can't wear both of them at the same time . I want a decision . \",\" But after all , it is your decision , not mine . \",\" Oh , yes . The green dress is very smart . but I can't be sure if it goes with a hat . \",\"What can I do for you ? \",\" I'd like to have my hair cut . \",\" OK . This way , please . \",\" You look so busy . \",\" We've particularly busy on Sunday . Please sit here . How do you wish it cut ? \",\" Short on both sides . Not so much in the middle . \",\" It's a long time since you had a haircut last time , isn't it ? \",\" Yes . You are right . \",\" How long ago ? \",\" About two months . \",\"Good afternoon , Miss . \",\" Good afternoon . I would like my hair done . \",\" What style do you want ? \",\" I'd like to try a new hair-style . Could you show me some pictures of hair styles ? \",\" Sure . Here you are . \",\" Thanks . Please give me the style in this picture here but make the wave longer . I would like hair spray , please . \",\" Yes , Miss .

How much should I pay ? \",\" One hundred yuan , please . \",\" Here you are . \",\" Thank you . \",\"What can I do for you ? \",\" I want my hair cut . \",\" How would you like your hair cut ? \",\" I'm not sure . What do you suggest ? \",\" Well , how about like this ? \",\" I don't like it . It's outdated . \",\" Okay . How about this style ? \",\" It seems a little too wild . \",\" Can you give me some idea of what you'd like ? \",\" I want a haircut just like that kind . \",\" OK , I see . \",\"I want to ask you for a favor . I want to rent an apartment here in Beijing , but as a foreigner , I don't know the normal practice . Can you give me some advice ? \",\" First , why don't you tell me what you need , such as how big a room , where you want to live , whether you want to live downtown , and what you like to do . Then I can figure out which apartment is most suitable for you . \",\" I am a student and want to live in Haitian , so that I can live close to my school . I like to play soccer and I like a quiet apartment so I can study . \",\" I think that an apartment with two rooms and a kitchen would suit your needs . I can introduce you to a place for rent near your school . The apartment is on the 7th floor , so it is very quiet and suitable for studying . \",\" That sounds great ! \",\" You can also go to the school's sports field to play soccer , and if you're lucky you might make some Chinese friends there . It is right near the market and has comfortable facilities . \",\" Thank you so much . That's very kind of you . \",\"Good morning . \",\" Good morning . May I help you ? \",\" I want to place a long-distance call to London . Is this the right counter ? \",\" Yes . Here's a booking form . Please write down the number you wish to call , the name of the person you want to talk to , and your own name for our reference . \",\" All right . Can you tell me when I will be able to get through ? \",\" It's hard to say . It depends on how busy the lines are . Please take a seat over there . We'll try to put you through as soon as possible . \",\" Thank you . \",\"May I help you ? \",\" Yes . I'd like to send this parcel to Changchun . \",\" How do you want to send it ? \",\" I guess I'll send it by airmail . \",\" Is there anything valuable ? \",\" No , there are only some vases . \",\" They are fragile articles .

You can take No . 846 from here , but you have to get off at Nanchengmen stop and change to No . 106 . \",\" That ' s a little troublesome . \",\" Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take No . 105 which will let you right off in front of the zoo gate . \",\" Maybe that ' s what I'll do .

We can talk to him and ask if he wants to join our group . \",\"Hey Michael . Where are you going ? \",\" No where special . I was just taking a walk . \",\" What for ? \",\" To get a little exercise . I'm so out of shape . \",\" Hey , I play basketball with a bunch of friends twice a week .

So , I made an appointment with the school counselor for her . \",\" That ' s a good idea . The counselor is a psychologist . He ' s better trained to handle these sorts of things . \",\" Yeah , that ' s what I told her . I ' m glad she ' s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own . \",\" Yeah , me too . \",\"Have you seen the movie Batwoman ? \",\" No , not yet . Is it good ? \",\" Yes , it's quite amusing , actually . Good plot , and Sharon Stone's in it . \",\" Oh , she's good . She must be getting on a bit now . \",\" Yeah , but she looks amazing . \",\" So what's the movie about ? \",\" Well , it's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . But then she got reincarnated as a cat . \",\" Huh ? \",\" I know . Stay with me . She then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . First , though , she had to discover her true cat nature . At the end she had a big fight with Sharon Stone , who was the real danger in the company . She had actually murdered the boss , who was her husband , and then tried to frame Batwoman for the murder , so everyone thought Batwoman was evil . \",\" I see . Batwoman married the boss ? \",\" No . Sharon Stone was married to the boss , who treated her badly , so she killed him . So where was I ? OK , so then , at the same time she fell in love with a cop , who was investigating the murder of the boss . Finally , she ditched the cop to follow her feline nature . \",\" Wait a minute , I'm lost . The cop killed the boss ? \",\" No , Sharon Stone did . \",\" And Sharon Stone is Batwoman ? \",\" Haven't you been listening to a word I've been saying ? \",\"Hi Mike .

What are you doing besides exercising ? \",\" That's about all . \",\" I think if you eat better , it will help tremendously . \",\" Sleep is good too . I heard people who sleep an average of eight hours a day have less health problems . \",\" Looks like there are a lot of things to do to stay healthy . \",\" True . But I think it is worth it . When you get old , you want to be healthy and active . \",\"Yes , I think there is something wrong with my car . \",\" What's the matter ? \",\" When I tried to back it , I found it was out of order . I can't see where the trouble is . \",\" Let me see . \",\" Is it serious ? \",\" No , the damage is minor . \",\" And when will it be OK ? \",\" 4:00 p . m .. \",\" OK . Thank you . \",\"Mike , I'm afraid I can't come back home for dinner tonight . \",\" Not back home for dinner again ? That's the third time this week ! \",\" I'm sorry . Our company has just opened . There are always too many things to handle . You know that . \",\" You don't have to explain . Suit yourself . \",\" Please forgive me . You have my word .

This is what you have to do to get noticeable results . \",\" I don't think I have the discipline for that . \",\" Just think of it as a hobby . Then it's actually fun . \",\"What do you do besides work and watching TV ? \",\" When I have some time , I like to exercise . \",\" Do you go jogging or do you go to a health club ? \",\" I joined Samsung Health Club a couple of months ago . \",\" How do you exercise ? \",\" I usually spend 30 minutes on the bicycle for the Carpio , and then I lift weight for about 45 minutes . \",\" How often do you go ? \",\" I want to go four times a week , but I'm too lazy . Last week , I only went to workout once . \",\"What can I do for you ? \",\" I want to get my car washed . \",\" Would you like regular car wash package ? \",\" I don't know what you mean . \",\" Well , we will wash the exterior form top to bottom . We use a special shampoo , which gives the body that extra shine . \",\" Do you wash windows ? \",\" Of course . We wash the windows inside and out . \",\" What about the interior ? \",\" We use a vacuum cleaner that removes all the dirt , and we throw away all of the trash that we can find . \",\" Sounds good , regular car wash package will be OK . \",\" OK . I see . \",\"This looks wonderful , Madame Culot . \",\" Yes , it's very nice . All our foreign visitors enjoy it . The food is wonderfully well-prepared . Let me know if you need any help with the menu . \",\" Thank you . Mmm . Can you tell me about the terrine ? \",\" Yes . A terrine is a kind of meat pate . It's meat turned into a paste . It sounds horrible but it's actually really good . \",\" Mmm . Maybe another time . \",\" You could try the ravioli .

I like the fish here . Would you like some wine ? \",\" Oh , yes . That would be lovely . \",\"You look great ! How do you stay in such good shape ? \",\" Well , I go jogging every morning , eat a healthful diet and work out in a gymnasium twice a week . \",\" Wow , it sounds like a lot of work . I guess I'm too lazy to do all that . \",\"Welcome . Can I help you with anything ? \",\" Hi . I'm shopping for my boyfriend's birthday . Do you have any suggestions ? \",\" Let's see .

I'll take them . \",\"What happened to your car ? \",\" A tow truck was towing my car and put all those dents in my car . \",\" Are they going to pay you for the damages ? \",\" They're saying it was already there . \",\" What the hell . That doesn't make sense . What are you going to do ? \",\" I have to go to court . A cop was there so he can prove that the damage wasn't there . \",\" That sucks . I'd be pissed if that happened to me . \",\" I got an estimate and it's four thousand dollars . \",\" Oh my gosh . Damn ... screw the court , I would burn down their store . \",\" We'll see what happens after court . \",\"Excuse me . Can you tell me where the Wal-Mart supermarket is ? \",\" Turn right at the second crossing and then go straight for two blocks . \",\" Is it far from here ? \",\" No , it ' s only ten-minute's walk . \",\" Thanks a lot . \",\" You ' re welcome . \",\"Excuse me , but can you tell me the way to the railway station ? \",\" Just go straight along this street , turn left at the first crossing and walk straight ahead about 100 meters .

Do you think a brown one will do ? \",\" Well , the brown one is beautiful indeed , but I think the black one will suit you better . \",\" Really ?

I'll take it . \",\"Would you please recommend a diamond for me ? \",\" OK . How about this diamond necklace ? \",\" I prefer a diamond mounted in a ring . \",\" Then .

How about you ? \",\" Only when I go out . I'm not a big drinker . \",\" How much can you drink ? \",\" I usually only have 2 beers . \",\" You're a light weight . \",\" How much can you drink ? \",\" I'm usually drinking all night long . At least 10 drinks . \",\" Don't you spend a lot of money then ? \",\" No . We usually go to places that have specials . Dante's over on the Ave has $ 5.00 pitchers on Mondays . So for ten , fifteen bucks , I can get a lot of drinks . \",\" That's true . \",\" If you don't like beer , have you tried mixed drinks ? Some of them are pretty good . \",\" I like beer , it's just that I get a headache when I drink more than 3 . \",\" You just have to build up a tolerance . I used to be like that . But your body gets used to it . \",\" It'll take awhile , but I'm working on it . \",\" Hey let's go out tomorrow night . The Ram Bar and Grill is having a special on pitchers . \",\" Alright . \",\"Hello . In order to kill your time you can experience our facial massage for free . \",\" Really ? OK ! \",\" This way please . First , we should clean your face with our clarifying cream . And then we use the massage cream . Next do the massage .

What can I do for you , sir ? \",\" Good morning . I'd like to have a haircut . \",\" Very well . Please sit down here . Do you want me to cut your hair very close ? \",\" Please cut the sides shorter , but not so much at the back . \",\" It's such a hot season , isn't it ? May I suggest thinning out the top ? \",\" That's a good idea . But leave the front as it is now . \",\" ( several minutes later ) Now it's done . Is it satisfactory ? \",\" Very good , thanks . \",\" Anything else I can do for you , sir ? \",\" No , thanks . \",\"Hi ! Do you know what's for dinner ? I'm starving ! \",\" We're on our own tonight . Dad's taking mom out . \",\" Out ? What do you mean out ? \",\" You know , on a date . They're going to dinner . \",\" Dad and Mom ? \",\" Yep . They said they're reviving an old tradition . \",\" You mean this is going to be a regular thing ? \",\" That's right , once a week . Do you want to order a Pizza ? \",\"Shall we go to the library by subway ? \",\" Yes , it's far quicker and less complicated . \",\" OK . There is no subway in my city . \",\" Really ? \",\" Yes .

Anything else ? \",\" A sack of cherries , please . \",\" Here you are . \",\"May I help you ? \",\" Yes . I'm looking for some perfume . Do you have perfumes with a light scent ? \",\" How about this one ? It smells like green tea and is our best seller . Try it . \",\" It does smell good , How much is it ? \",\" It goes for $ 40 . \",\" OK . I'll take this one . \",\"Here is your spicy diced chicken with peanuts , sir . \",\" Thank you . It looks very attractive . \",\" I would advise you to enjoy the dish while it is hot . \",\" Tasty and tender ! It must be one of the famous local dishes . \",\" Yes . It's a traditional dish . \",\" And it must be very particular in cooking . \",\" You are right , sir . To prepare it , a Sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn reddish brown , and then puts diced chicken breast meat into the pot with other condiments and peanuts . That's why the dish has a bright colour . \",\" I see . \",\" Enjoy yourself , sir . \",\"What kind of cuisine do you have ? \",\" We have Sichuan food , Hangzhou food and Beijing Food . Which do you like best ? \",\" Hangzhou food . \",\" OK . How about Dongpo meat ? \",\" All right . I'll take it . \",\" Do you like to use chopsticks \",\" Yes , I like using chopsticks . \",\" Do you like some soup ? \",\" Yes , but I don't know what soup you have . \",\" We have beef soup and tomato soup . \",\" Good . I prefer beef soup . \",\" According to usual practices , we serve dishes first and then soup . If you like we'll bring you some soup first . \",\" Save it until you've served dishes . \",\" All right . I'll be back right away . \",\"Taxi . \",\" Yes , sir , where are you going ? \",\" I am going to the railway station . \",\" Get on , please . \",\" Thank you . Can we get there in half an hour ? \",\" I am not sure , sir . Generally we can , but look at the traffic . It's the rush hour . \",\" My train will leave at 3:00 , I'll have to arrive there before 2:50 . \",\" We are really in a hurry . \",\" Can't we go faster ? \",\" I'll do my best . \",\"Can you show me how to use chopsticks ? \",\" With pleasure . \",\" Oh , it is not easy to learn ! \",\" I think you are a quick learner . \",\" Well , I don't think I can manage with it . \",\" In that case , shall I ask the waiter to bring you a knife and fork ? \",\" That's good , thank you . \",\"May I help you ? \",\" Is this the right counter for gloves ? \",\" Yes , madam . What sort of gloves do you want ? \",\" Well , let me see some of each . \",\" Certainly . What size do you take ? \",\" Six and a quarter , I believe , but you'd better measure my hand to make sure . \",\" I think a six is your size . How do you like these ? I can recommend them , they're very reliable . \",\" Very well , I'll take these two . \",\"May I take your order now ? \",\" Yes , I'll have a boiled egg with toast and orange juice , please . \",\" How would you like your eggs ? \",\" Hard-boiled , please . \",\" And your toast , light or dark ? \",\" Dark , please . \",\" Now or later ? \",\" Later will do . \",\" Will there be anything else ? \",\" No , that's all . Thanks . \",\" One hard-boiled egg with toast and orange juice to follow . \",\" That's right . \",\" Just a moment , please . \",\"May I have a reservation ? \",\" Yes , of course . \",\" I've got three guests today . We'd like a table next to the window . \",\" All right . Your name , please . \",\" I'm Chen Liang . \",\" Chen Liang , a table for four . And when are you coming ? \",\" We may come at 6:30 p . m . \",\" OK . We look forward to seeing you . Goodbye . \",\" Goodbye . \",\"What are you doing ? \",\" I'm watching TV . \",\" Are there any good programs on TV ? \",\" Tingling is on TV . \",\" Which Channel is it ? \",\" Channel 8 . \",\" It doesn't seem quite interesting . Would you change the channel ? \",\"I think we should do the floors before we work on the curtains and walls . \",\" Why ? it doesn't make sense . If we do the floors first , and then paint the walls , we will get paint all over our new floor . \",\" Hmm Maybe you're right . But I can't stand all this green carpet here . And besides , I know how to paint . I will just cover everything with drop cloth . I won't get anything on the floor . \",\" Are you sure ? \",\" Yes , I'm sure I've done a lot of house painting in my life . And my mother was very picky . If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . So I learned to be very careful . \",\" Alright . Then maybe we can do the floor first . These wood floors under this carpet are beautiful . And me too \\u2014 \\u2014 I can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here . But how can we get it out ? Do we have to hire someone ? \",\" Absolutely not . We can remove the carpet ourselves . Carpet is held down with carpet nails . You just need to pull it hard and it will come up . \",\" Great . Then , after we remove the carpet , we need to redo all the wood floors . Right ? \",\" Yes . But we should hire someone for that . That will probably be expensive . And it has to be done right . \",\" And then , after the floors are done , we can start to move our furniture in . \",\" Sure . If we can get an appointment with someone to do the floors , we should probably be able to have the furniture in here after a week or so . I can get all the carpet out this weekend . \",\"Hello , is that the Peace Restaurant ? \",\" Yes . May I help you ? \",\" Yes . I'd like a table for six at 7:00 this evening . Can you arrange it for us ? \",\" Just a minute . I'll check if there is any availability . I'm sorry , sir . There isn't any table left for 7:00 , but we can give you one at 8: 00 . Would you like to make a reservation at that time ? \",\" Let me see . It seems a little late . \",\" Usually , the restaurant will be quieter at that time . \",\" OK . I'll change the time to 8: 00 . \",\" Very good , sir . A table for 6 at 8: 00 this evening . May I have your name , please ? \",\" It's John . \",\" Thank you very much . Bye . \",\"Do you live in the red house at the end of the road ? \",\" Yes , I live in that house with my parents and my sister . \",\" We also have a cat and a dog . \",\" Do you take your dog for a walk every day ? \",\" No . My father takes the dog for a walk every Monday , Tuesday and Sunday . \",\" And I take the dog for a walk every Wednesday , Thursday and Friday . \",\" Who takes the dog on Saturday ? \",\" On Saturday we all go to the park and the dog comes with us . \",\" Do you help with the housework ? \",\" My mum and my sister do the housework and cooking but I clean my room . \",\"You're right . Watching movies at home is way cheaper than going to the theater , too . I like downloading movies too because it's easy and fast . \",\" I agree . And it's very convenient . \",\" Have you ever heard of a movie rental company called Netflix ? They send the movies directly to your house in the mail . \",\" Really ? That's great ! I'm going to try that next time . \",\" Yeah , but I wish they delivered video games too . Then I would never leave my house ! \",\"Good evening , Saliva . What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ? \",\" I am cooking now ! \",\" Are you good at cooking ? \",\" I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking ! \",\" It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? ! \",\" I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ? \",\" Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty . \",\" That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much . \",\" I have the same idea as yours . \",\" It's OK . Please have a taste of it . \",\" Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious . \",\" Thank you for your praise . \",\" Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ? \",\" I am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc . \",\" So many dishes . Next Friday week is my birthday . I would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , OK ? \",\" Why not ? It is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking . \",\" Thanks a lot . \",\" It's my pleasure . \",\"Alright , tell me what you think about this one . \",\" Don't you think it's a bit bright ? \",\" Yeah , maybe you're right . How about this outfit ? \",\" That dress looks lovely on you , but it's not very practical , is it ? \",\" No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just want to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It's casual , yet sophisticated . \",\" I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It's too plain on its own . \",\" How about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ? \",\" That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ? \",\" That's a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense . \",\" Thanks . You'd be OK on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? \",\" Yep . Here it is . What do you think ? \",\" That looks great . Just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? \",\" The leopard print sounds fabulous . OK , I'll take it . \",\"Can I borrow this magazine from you ? It's really interesting and I can't put it down . \",\" I am sorry , but I can't lend it to you now , for I haven't finished reading it . If you don't mind , I can lend you some back numbers to you . \",\" That would be very kind of you . By the way , is it a monthly magazine ? \",\" No , it is a fortnightly . So , you see , I can get the new one quite soon . \",\"Boy , come here ! \",\" Yes , sir ! What can I do for you ? \",\" Bring me a cup of coffee , please . \",\" Will you have it strong or weak ? \",\" I prefer strong . \",\"Won't you have some of this ? \",\" Yes , thanks . \",\" It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue . \",\" It's very good . How do you make it ? \",\" I use a special dressing and homemade catsup . \",\" This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day . \",\" I'm glad you like it . \",\" You Americans usually have nutritious food . \",\" Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ? \",\" We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience . \",\" I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did . She was a great cook . She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night . \",\"Here , Let me get the door for you . \",\" Thanks . \",\" Do you need a hand with that ? \",\" Actually , I could use some help . Thank you so much . \",\" Don't worry about it . \",\"Doctor , my child is nine years old , and I recently found that he was constantly telling lies about how he is doing at school . \",\" Is he doing very well at school ? \",\" He is doing OK , but he pretends he is doing much better by telling lies . \",\" What's his problem ? \",\" This may be complicated . But I think he may need to build up his self-esteem . \",\" How can his he do that ? \",\" There are a lot of ways to help a kid build up self-esteem , but to begin with , you can try and give him more rewards . Rewards will help a chil improve his self-esteem . \",\"Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive . \",\" What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them . \",\" But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past . \",\" Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds . \",\"There are many new kinds of newspapers . I find it hard to choose among them . Which is the most popular paper circulating in our city ? \",\" I'd recommend you the Morning Paper , it is true that the paper is a newly issued one , but its circulation is rising . Last month , it reached to three hundred thousand , which is a very good figure for a new paper . \",\" What's the reason that people prefer to read this one ? \",\" I think perhaps the news stories in it are truthful and accurate . It also has a special page about the stock market ; maybe this is the real reason for its popularity . Many people are now speculating in the stock market . \",\" I can predict it will have the largest circulation in one or two years . \",\"Good morning , Mrs . Smith . \",\" Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother . \",\" What kind of books does she like ? \",\" She's very fond of detective stories . \",\"Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ? \",\" Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk . \",\" Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk . \",\" I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator . \",\" Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ? \",\" Nothing . \",\" What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see . \",\" Promise that you won't get angry . \",\" OK , I promise . What is it ? \",\" It's a kitty . \",\" Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house . \",\" Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble . \",\" No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here . \",\" Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame . \",\" All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up . \",\" I will . Thank you , Mummy . \",\"There are thousands of magazines published in the world to meet the needs of different readers . But only a few of them are influential world-wide . \",\" You have hit the point . It's really hard for a magazine to be well known to people of various ages and educational backgrounds . \",\" But I think Digest is supposed to be the top one . Its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . It's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it . \",\" To my mind , the success of Digest is in the clever selection of its articles in each issue . \",\"Hello , do you have any vacancies ? \",\" Yes , something just opened up . \",\" What kind of apartment is it ? \",\" It's a one-bedroom , one-bathroom apartment . \",\"What kind of films do you like best ? \",\" I like feature films best . How about you ? \",\" I don't like feature films . I think sometimes it loses contact with reality . I like to see some documentary films . What kind of feature films do you like best ? \",\" I always like to see the oldies , like The Sound of Music , Gone with the Wind . They are realty the best - in the acting , the scene and the plot . \",\" You are sort of romantic . \",\"Hello ? \",\" Hi , is Heather there please ? \",\" Sorry , I think you have the wrong number . \",\" Is this 617-228-2289 ? \",\" Yes . Who are you looking for again ? \",\" Heather Johnson . \",\" Oh , I thought you said Laura . Sorry about that . This is the right number , but Heather's not here right now . \",\" Do you know where she went ? \",\" She went to the store to buy some groceries . Would you like to leave a message ? \",\" Yes , would you please tell her Eric Martin called ? \",\" Hi Eric , this is her roommate Kathy . I met you a couple months ago at the Christmas party . \",\" Oh , yes . How are you ? \",\" Good . Heather will be back in about 20 minutes . I'll tell her you called . \",\" OK . Thanks . \",\" Bye bye . \",\"I saw your ad in The New York Times . I am seriously considering one of the apartments listed in it . \",\" We are happy to help you . May I know which one it is ? \",\" The two-bedroom apartment on 38th east street . \",\" Oh , it is conveniently located , isn't it ? \",\" That's why I think it may suit my needs . \",\" I believe it will . It comes furnished . You can move in immediately after the lease is signed . \",\" The ad says the rent would be 840 dollars per month . Is it true ? \",\" Yes . But not including the utilities . \",\" Will it possible for me to rent the apartment on a month-by-month basis ? \",\" I believe that can be arranged . But there should be a refundable security deposit , you know . \",\" Oh , that's no problem . \",\"How much is the rent ? \",\" The rent is $ 1500 per month . \",\" And how much is the deposit ? \",\" The deposit is $ 500 . \",\"Mmm ... it is delicious . \",\" Oh , do you really like it ? \",\" Yes . It's superb . \",\" Well , it's kind of you to say so . \",\" In fact , could I ask you for the recipe ? \",\" Sure . It's really very easy . First , mix together an egg , two teaspoons of salt , and two pounds of ground beef . Then , add two ounces of milk . Are you with me ? \",\" Yes , I've got it . \",\" OK . Next , put the mixture into a baking pan and bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees . \",\" Wait a minute . I didn't catch you there . Could you repeat that ? \",\" Sure . Bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees . \",\" Now , I've got it . Thank you . \",\"Hello , who's that speaking ? \",\" I am calling about the advertisement for a flat with a bedroom . Do you still have it now ? \",\" Yes , I do . \",\" Is there any furniture in it ? \",\" Yes , it's fully furnished . \",\" What's the rent for a year ? \",\" 15,000 Yuan , including water , but electricity and gas . \",\" Where is it located ? \",\" It's in International Trade Zone . It's only ten minutes ' walk from the nearest subway station . \",\" That's great . But can you make the rent cheaper , let's see , 12,000 Yuan ? \",\" The price can be talked over . How about coming around and taking a look at it first ? \",\" OK . I will be free at tomorrow afternoon . I'll take a taxi to get there . \",\" All right , see you . \",\"Hey Sarah , I'm having some trouble finding an apartment . Can you help me look at some listings online ? \",\" Sure . What kind of apartment are you looking for ? \",\" Well , it has to be cheap . I don't want a really expensive apartment . \",\" OK . Would you like to live in a studio ? \",\" Sure , a studio would be fine . \",\"Jeff , look at this listing ! It says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . What do you think ? \",\" Well I think I can afford that apartment . But are pets allowed ? \",\" Hmm ... let me look . Yes , it says it's a pet-friendly building . \",\" That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ? \",\" It says it's located in the suburbs . \",\"Well , this apartment is really a must-see . Will you come with me to look at it this weekend ? \",\" Sure . And if you rent it , maybe I can help you find a roommate too . \",\" Great ! Do you know someone else who is also looking for an apartment ? \",\" Yes , my friend Steve . I'll introduce you . \",\"It's located in the suburbs ? Well even though that sounds like a steal , I really want something downtown . \",\" OK . Well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive . \",\" I know , that's my problem . What do you think I should do ? \",\" Well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate . \",\" Oh , great idea ! \",\"Well , what about this two-bedroom apartment ? The listing says it's right in the heart of the city , just steps from the metro . \",\" Wow , that would be very convenient . How much is the rent ? \",\" It says it's $ 1600 . But if you share it with another person , that's only $ 800 per month . \",\" That definitely sounds like a steal . I think that is a very trendy neighborhood as well . \",\" That's true . I know that there are lots of popular restaurants and coffee shops around there . \",\"I'm calling to ask about your apartment advertised . \",\" Yes , we've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . And they are all newly renovated . \",\" That sounds fantastic ! But I am looking for something closer to the downtown , as I spend most of my time at the office . \",\" No problem . We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square . It's perfect for people busy with office work . It is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details . \",\" I'm sure it is wonderful , but I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost . \",\" Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find the right apartment there . \",\" Great ! I'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . Could you tell me the detailed address ? \",\" Of course . It's just at 19 Lingual Road . You can phone me again if you cann't find the right place . \",\" Ok . Thank you . \",\"Good evening , Yanking Restaurant . \",\" Could I reserve a table for Saturday , September 16th at 8: 00 p . m . ? \",\" Certainly , sir . For how many people , please ? \",\" For two people . We would like a quiet table , please . \",\" Of course . May I have your name , please ? \",\" This is Mr . William . \",\" Can you spell that , please ? \",\" William . W-I-L-L-I-A-M . \",\" Thank you , Mr . William . Goodbye . \",\"A friend told me I might find a room here . \",\" Yes . I'll have a room free next week . \",\" What do you charge ? \",\" 12,000 a year , but you can't get visitors to live in . \",\" OK . Would it be all right to look at the room first ? \",\" Could you come back later ? We're right in the middle of dinner . \",\"I'd like to reserve a table for three this evening . \",\" Just a moment , sir . Let me check the reservation list . Sorry , I'm afraid we're fully booked tonight . Would you like to make a reservation some other time ? \",\" Do you have pot service at noon ? \",\" Yes , the same service and food as in the evening . \",\" OK , we'll come at half past eleven tomorrow . \",\" OK . Your name , please ? \",\" Black . \",\" Good . Thank you very much . \",\"Can you show me some jade , please ? \",\" Yes , of course . Do you like a jade necklace ? \",\" No , but I do like jade bracelets . \",\" Here are all kinds of jades . Choose whatever you like , please . \",\" Thank you . ( A moment later ) Oh , this one is quite impressive . I'll take it . By the way , do you sell pearl earrings ? \",\" Yes . Natural pearls or cultured pearls ? We have both kinds . \",\" I wonder which looks more lustrous . \",\" Well , natural pearls are of higher value , but the cultured pearls have equal lustre and are just as beautiful . \",\" Oh , I see . I think I prefer a natural one . \",\"Do you take in students ? I've been told you might have a vacant room . \",\" Yes . If you don't mind sharing room with someone else , there's one available . \",\" How much are you asking ? \",\" 800 Yuan a month . \",\" Could I have a look at it , please ? \",\" Sorry , but I'm on my way out now . Could you come back in an hour ? \",\"I'd like to buy one of these refrigerators . Do I have to pay in cash ? \",\" No , we have an easy-payment plan . One-third down , and the balance in six months . \",\" Fine . Will you work out the details , please ? \",\" Certainly . Would you sit here please ? I'll call our credit manager . \",\" Thank you . \",\" It's just a formality , but for hire purchase we usually require references . \",\" What kind of references do you need ? \",\" Perhaps your employer could supply us with one . \",\" I'm sure he could , but I prefer not to bother him . Would my bank do ? \",\" Certainly . A simple letter from your bank would be quite satisfactory . \",\"When can I see the one-bedroom apartment ? \",\" There's an open house this weekend . \",\" What time does the open house start ? \",\" It starts at 11AM in the morning . \",\"I wonder if you can help me . I'm looking for a room . \",\" Yes . I've got a small room . \",\" How much is it ? \",\" 200 Yuan a week , but smoking is not allowed . \",\" OK . Can I see the room now ? \",\" Would you mind waiting ? I'm on the telephone . \",\"Mmmm ... This apartment seems a little expensive . Do you have any cheap studios ? \",\" Actually , the one-bedroom is the only vacant apartment right now . \",\" Do you think any studios will open up soon ? \",\" No , not for a few months . \",\"What kind of lease is it ? \",\" It's a one-year lease . \",\" Can I have a month-to-month lease ? I only want to rent the apartment for five months . \",\" No , all the leases are for one year . We don't have month-to-month leases . \",\" Well , then I don't think this would be a good apartment for me . Thank you anyway . \",\" You're welcome . \",\"Are utilities included in the rent ? \",\" Gas and water are included . \",\" Do I have to pay for electricity myself ? \",\" Yes , electricity is not included in the rent . \",\"Excuse me , How do I get to the Grand hotel ? \",\" I am sorry , I didn ' t catch what you said . Could you repeat it please ? \",\" The Grand hotel , is it far from here ? \",\" Sorry , my English isn ' t so good . Could you speak a little slower ? \",\"What games do you like ? \",\" I like word games . \",\" How about a game of bridge ? \",\" I don't like it at all . \",\" What about guessing games ? \",\" I'm not one for the games . \",\" Let's play other game . \",\" What about playing go ? \",\" OK . \",\"Excuse me , you look lost . Can I help you ? \",\" Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station . \",\" Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right . \",\" Right ? OK , got it . \",\" Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ? \",\" Next left then right ? OK . \",\"Miss , would you like to try this free sample of our new suntan cream ? \",\" Sure , why not ? \",\" This is a new product of company this year . It's oil-free . \",\" I see . It feels very light on the skin . \",\" It gives your skin a very natural healthy look . \",\" I like the cool smell , too . \",\"What's the problem , sir ? \",\" I bought this toy gun from your store two weeks ago . My son played with it only twice and it broke . \",\" Do you keep the receipt ? \",\" Yes , and I have the warranty , too . \",\" What do you want me to do about it ? \",\" I'd like you to replace this one without charge if you can . \",\"This way , please . We've got a nice private for you . \",\" That's good . Thank you . \",\" Here we are . I hope you will like it . \",\" It's good . It's a nice room . \",\" And here is the menu . I'll come back soon . \",\" Thank you . \",\"Do you play cards ? \",\" Of course and very well . \",\" What's the English for Hongtao , Leitao , Meihua and Fangpian ? \",\" Oh , very easy . They are heart , spade , club and diamond . \",\"Good evening . Welcome to our restaurant . \",\" Good evening . We want a dinning room with a table for eight . \",\" I'm sorry , sir . The rooms are not available now . But would you like to have your dinner in the dinning hall ? I can find a table by the window for you . \",\" No , thanks . We have made a reservation before . \",\" Can I have your name , please ? \",\" My name is James . \",\" I'll ask waitress to show you the way . \",\" Thanks . \",\"Hey , Ann . You don't have a pen , do you ? \",\" Sure , here you go . \",\" Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too . \",\" Of course . There you are . \",\" Thanks so much . I owe you one . \",\"So click here , then up to the top . \",\" Er ... Hum ... Got it . \",\" Then open that window . Yeah , that one . \",\" Right ! \",\" And that's it . You're done . \",\" I see what you mean . That was pretty easy after all . \",\"Sam , can we stop at this bicycle shop ? \",\" Do you want to buy a new bicycle ? \",\" Yes , and they have a sale on now . \",\" What happened to your old one ? \",\" I left it at my parent's house , but I need one here as well . \",\" I've been using Jim's old bike but he needs it back . \",\" Let's go then . \",\" Look at this mountain bike . It is only \\u00a3 330 . Do you like it ? \",\" I prefer something like this one - a touring bike , but it is more expensive . \",\" How much is it ? \",\" The price on the tag says \\u00a3 565 but maybe you can get a discount . \",\" OK , let's go and ask . \",\"I'd like to taste some local dishes . What would you recommend ? \",\" That's fine . You must try this dish . \",\" Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ? \",\" It's fish steamed and served with our special sauce . \",\" Is it good ? \",\" Sure . It's a most popular dish . \",\" I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together . \",\" We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ? \",\" What kind do you have ? \",\" We have French and Thousand Island . \",\" Make it Thousand Island . \",\"I'd like to buy a house about 300m with a garden . Can you help me ? \",\" Sure . We've helped more than ten thousand people buy and sell houses . We're the No . 1 realtor in this community . I recommend this house ( He points at a picture ) . \",\" Where is it ? \",\" On a hill to the east of the Tarsus river . You have a good view of the beautiful sunrise and sunset . You can't find a better home to live in . \",\" How many rooms are there ? \",\" Eight rooms , a roomy kitchen , two modem bathrooms , a lovely dining room , a gorgeous living room and three sweet bedrooms . All are built with first-rate materials . \",\" How much is it ? \",\" 6 million . You needn't pay the whole price at one time . You just pay 50 % in cash . We'll process the legal documents for you and then you can borrow the other 50 % from a bank and repay it in installments . We ask for only 1 % as commission . \",\" OK . How much is the deposit ? \",\" Ten thousand . \",\"Hi Sam . \",\" Hi Chris . I am glad to see you . Can you help me with my new computer ? \",\" When did you buy your new computer ? \",\" I bought it yesterday afternoon and they delivered it this morning at 10:45 . \",\" So what's the problem ? \",\" I am not sure . I just can't connect to the net . \",\" Can I have a look ? \",\" Of course , come in . \",\" Oh this is the new little EEE notebook from Asks . How much did you pay ? \",\" It was only 345 pounds . \",\" Very nice . I am sure we will sort out your Internet in no time . \",\" I am on my way to the doctor now , but I should be back in about 45 minutes . Can I come back at around 3:15 ? \",\" That will be perfect . \",\"Are you ready to order now , sir ? \",\" Yes . \",\" Would you like an appetizer ? \",\" Yes . I'd like a crab cocktail . \",\" Would you like some soup first ? \",\" Very well . \",\" What kind of soup would you like ? \",\" I want egg soup . \",\" Have you decided on anything ? \",\" I'd like to have some meat . \",\" How about stewed-fried steamed pork ? \",\" No , thank you . \",\" Are you interested in today's special ? \",\" What is it ? \",\" Twice cooked spicy pork slices . \",\" OK . Let me try it . \",\" Anything else ? \",\" No , thank you \",\"The car isn't running smoothly . I'd like to have a look at it . \",\" What's the matter with it ? \",\" I'm not sure . It could be the tires . Let's stop here . \",\" How about the tires ? \",\" Nothing serious . The right one needs some air . \",\"Excuse me , do you know where the Post Office is ? \",\" Yes , it's not very far from here . Follow this road until you get to the traffic lights . You will see a small restaurant at the corner . \",\" Is the restaurant on the right or on the left hand side of the road ? \",\" It is on the right . But it is on the other side of the lights . \",\" OK . Do I turn on the lights or do I go straight ? \",\" You go straight on at the lights , but just past the restaurant building there is a small road to your right . \",\" And do I take that road ? \",\" Yes , you need to turn right and follow that road for about four minutes . You will see the Post Office on your left . \",\" Is there a Post Office sign on the building ? \",\" Yes and it is quite a big building so you won't miss it . There is also a small supermarket next to it . \",\" Thank you very much . \",\" You're welcome . \",\"Playing the chess is very exhausting , isn't ? \",\" No , doing it in the long run will make you an acute man . \",\" I'm afraid playing the chess like that will soon make me an old man . I noticed that most chess players were bald . \",\" That's because you are always fixing your eyes on the bald . \",\"May I take your order now ? \",\" Yes , please . What's special today ? Any special recommendations ? \",\" Certainly . I would recommend ' Songshuguiyu ' . \",\" The name sounds fascinating . What is it exactly ? \",\" Well , it is sweet and sour fried Mandarin fish . \",\" Sorry , I'm not interested in vinegar . \",\" Then , how about this one ? \",\" OK . I'll have that . \",\" Very good . Could I serve you anything else ? \",\" Thank you . That's enough . \",\" My pleasure . Just a little while , your order will be ready very soon . Please enjoy your lunch . \",\" Thanks . \",\"Let's see . I had the salmon starter which was \\u00a3 5.90 and my Pizza was \\u00a3 8.25 . \",\" I had the soup and bruschetta which all together is \\u00a3 4.50 and my trout for the main course was \\u00a3 12 . \",\" So that's \\u00a3 14.15 for me and \\u00a3 16.50 for you . \",\" Yes and shall we go fifty-fifty for the wine ? \",\" Yes , so that's an extra \\u00a3 6 for both of us . \",\" So now your bill comes to \\u00a3 20.15 and I need to pay \\u00a3 22.50 . \",\" And I had a dessert - that's another \\u00a3 3.50 . And you had coffee which is \\u00a3 2 . \",\" And is that all ? \",\" Yes , this is everything on the list . \",\" So now my bill is \\u00a3 24.50 and yours come to \\u00a3 23.65 . Is that correct ? \",\" Yes , that's exactly it . How much tip shall we give the waiter ? \",\" I think \\u00a3 5 would be good . \",\"Good evening . \",\" Good evening . We've a reservation for a table for four . My name is Tim . \",\" Let me check the list . Yes , we do have a reservation under Mr . Tim . \",\" But there is a change in the number of people . There are seven of us . Three of my friends are coming soon . \",\" It doesn't matter . Follow me , please . What do you think of the table in the center of the dining room ? \",\" Well , it's a window table that we've booked . \",\" I'm sorry , but you see , all the tables by the window are small , with up to 4 seats . \",\" Oh , I see . We'll have to make up with the center one . \",\" Thank you for your understanding , Mr . Tim . \",\" If a Mr . Wu comes to look for me , just take him here . \",\" Yes , I will . \",\"I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking . \",\" We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments . \",\" I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house . \",\" We need to find a good realtor . \",\" Not necessary . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . \",\" What do you mean ? \",\" Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . \",\" But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles . \",\" Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them . \",\" I still think we should have a realtor . We're new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has any problems . \",\" Of course we need a house inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . As for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us . \",\" So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? \",\" It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . \",\" And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? \",\" Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . \",\" Why ? \",\" That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . \",\" Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . \",\" It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . \",\" I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . \",\" All right . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drugstore . \",\"Where to , madam ? \",\" Grand Central Station , please . I want to catch a 6 p . m . train . \",\" I think you'll make it if we don't get stuck in a traffic jam . \",\" Here is the Grand Central Station . \",\" Thank you . How much is the fare ? \",\" The meter reads 9.15 dollars . \",\" Here you are . Keep the change . \",\" Thank you . \",\"Good evening , sir . Welcome to our restaurant . \",\" Thank you . \",\" Do you have a reservation ? \",\" Yes , I do . \",\" May I have your name , please ? \",\" Yes , it's Mr . Brown . \",\" Mr . Brown . We were expecting you . This way , please . Will this table be fine ? \",\" Oh , this is just fine . \",\" Please take a seat . \",\" Thank you . \",\" Here is the menu . \",\"Would you like to have a piece of cake ? \",\" No , thank you . I'm on a diet . \",\" Why ? You're not fat . \",\" I'm considering entering for the beauty contest this summer , so I must have a slender figure . \",\" Women of all shapes would be beautiful if they are self-confident . \",\" I'm afraid the judges do not think so . All the beauty contests are for slim girls only . \",\" Well . There's a beauty contest in Thailand just for fat beauties . \",\" How much do they weigh ? \",\" All the beauties who entered the contest were over 80kg . \",\" But I'm not fat enough to enter that contest . \",\"Excuse me . Could you tell me the way to the Star Hotel ? \",\" Yes . Go down the main road . You can't miss it . \",\" How long will it take me to get there ? \",\" It's only about a five-minute walk . \",\" Thank you very much . \",\" You're welcome . \",\"Where to , sir . \",\" To this place , please . \",\" Star Hotel . OK . \",\" How long does it take to get to the hotel ? \",\" About 20 minutes . \",\" Here's the hotel . \",\" How much is the fare ? \",\" That's 10 dollars . \",\"Good morning , madam . I think I'm lost here . The place I want to go to is a hotel called the Hilton . \",\" Do you know in which area ? \",\" No , I am sorry I have no idea . I am a stranger here . \",\" I see . Well , do you know anything near the hotel ? \",\" Oh , yes . My friend told me the hotel was near the Central Railway Station . \",\" Then you'll have to take a bus and get off at the Central Railway Station . \",\" Can you show me where the Central Railway Station is on this map ? \",\" OK . \",\"Hello , are you interested in this Honda ? \",\" Hi , I am just looking . \",\" It's a good car . \",\" What year is it ? \",\" 1999 . \",\" How about the mileage ? \",\" 6,000 miles , all highway mileage . \",\" What do you mean 7B \",\" Highway miles are not as bad as local miles . They do not hurt car as much . \",\" Oh , why such a high mileage ? \",\" The owner was commuting everyday crossing the state line . \",\" Okay . Does this car have a warranty ? \",\" One month . \",\" How do I make sure I am not buying a junk ? \",\" You'll check it out anyway you want . You can take it to a garage . \",\" How much is it ? \",\" $ 5,900 . \",\" I'll have to think about it . \",\" Leave your phone number , and I will give you a call if the price gets reduced . \",\" Okay . \",\"What else should we do now after the floors are done and after the furniture is in ? \",\" We need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings . \",\" I'm the painter . You can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains . That will probably be pretty expensive too . Having good curtains made isn't cheap . \",\" You mean we can't just buy curtains already made ? \",\" Absolutely not . The windows must be measured , and then the curtains need to be made professionally . So that will take a while . Maybe a month or so . \",\" While the curtains are being made , I can start having people look at the kitchen . I can't stand that old kitchen . I won't be able to cook there . I don't want to use that electric stove . \",\" We need to find an interior decorating company to redecorate the kitchen . I believe in Portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation . I will look in the Yellow Pages . I'd like a kitchen mostly in ivory and light green . \",\" I agree . The colors must be soft and pleasant . You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners . \",\" Me ? Cook our dinners ? Hah ! You will be cooking , dear . You will cook . \",\" No , I don't think so . I'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room . \",\" Well , I suppose we'll have to hire a cook then . So you won't be able to afford any clothes next year . \",\" And you'll have to sell your motorcycle . And your cameras . Right ? \",\" Maybe I'll cook once or twice a week . How is that ? \",\" Four times might be enough . Not once or twice . \",\"Hi , Mike . I am going to move on the first of next month . \",\" Congratulations ! So , have you started planning your move ? \",\" Yes , I am trying to find good movers now . Do you know any ? \",\" Not really . \",\" What did you do for your last move ? \",\" Since I did not have much staff , I asked my cousin to help me out . \",\" Oh . that's very nice of him . \",\" Yeah , it was . But I still have some information that I collected last time , and if you want , I will give it to you . \",\" Yes , please . \",\"Miss , may I help you ? \",\" Yes , I just wondered why the price between the ninth and tenth floor is so different . \",\" It's because of the view . \",\" Oh ! I see . Can you show me the location of Block I ? \",\" Sure . Please take a look at the model of the building . Nice Garden has a total of two blocks which are labeled Block I and Block II . Block I has a total of thirty-eighth floors . The thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth are penthouses . There are four units in one floor . The sizes of the units are one thousand square feet and one thousand and five hundred square feet . The size with one thousand square feet has three bedrooms and the biggest size has four bedrooms . \",\" How many elevators are there ? \",\" There are three elevators between one hundred and forty-eight units . \",\" How about the car-park space ? \",\" There are a total of one hundred and sixty parking spaces on the second and third floor , in which twelve are for visitors and the rest are for residents . \",\" Any other facilities ? \",\" Sure , on the fourth floor is a recreation quarter . There are two swimming pools . One is Olympic standard size and the other one is for children . Also , there is a gymnasium for resident members only . \",\" What is the completion date ? \",\" The completion date will be July 1st 2007 . \",\" How about the price and the bank mortgage ? \",\" Please check up the price list . The average unit price is five million Hong Kong dollars . There are eight different banks that will provide a seventy percent mortgage loan . Also , the developer will offer another ten percent mortgage to purchasers . \",\" How many payment methods are there ? \",\" It's all written on the brochure price list . I believe there will be one right for you . Please hurry up because almost half of units have already gone . \",\" Thank you . I think I have to talk to the bank representatives . Thank you for your help . \",\" You're welcome . \",\"You know , I'm a pretty laid-back person . I don't like to have lots of arguments or worry about lots of things . For example , I like to keep the apartment clean too , but if it gets a little dirty once in a while , that's not a big deal . \",\" I totally agree . I really like my lifestyle to be drama-free , and I don't want to argue about cleaning the apartment . My last roommate was a drama queen . Every time I forgot to take my shoes off , she got really mad and made a big deal out of it . \",\" Yeah , I really don't want a lot of drama in the apartment . It's important that we don't get on each other's nerves . \",\" That's right . We should try to be laid back and not do lots of things to bother one another . \",\"Excuse me , could you tell me which bus I should take to go to the railway station ? \",\" I think you'd better take the No . 16 bus . It can take you right there . \",\" How often dose this bus go there ? \",\" Every fifteen minutes . \",\" I really can't wait that long . Are there any other buses that can take me there ? \",\" The No . 2 bus also goes to the railway station . You may take it . \",\" Where can I find the bus ? \",\" The bus stop is not far from here . Go straight on and you can easily find it . \",\" Thanks a lot . \",\" You are welcome . \",\"Good morning , madam . What can I do for you ? ! \",\" I'd like a coffee please . \",\" Certainly , madam . What kind of coffee would you like ? \",\" What have you got ? \",\" Well , we have espresso , cappuccino , latte , skinny latte and Americano . \",\" Goodness me ! So many choices ! I think I'll have a cappuccino please . \",\" Here you are . You'll find the sugar just over there . \",\"Hi Steve , it's nice to meet you . I hear that you're looking for an apartment , and I just rented a two-bedroom downtown . I'm looking for a compatible roommate . \",\" Great , I'm looking for a place right in that area . Your apartment sounds ideal . \",\" Alright . So tell me , how would you describe yourself ? \",\" I'm pretty social and outgoing , and I like making new friends . But I'm not a party animal , and I like to keep the apartment clean . \",\" I'm like that too . I like to invite friends over sometimes , but I don't want to have lots of crazy parties at the apartment . \",\"What is your favorite coffee ? \",\" Irish coffee is my favorite . But I'm not particular on it . \",\" All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? \",\" Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . \",\" I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient . \",\" Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world . \",\" I agree . I heard that in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ? \",\" Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee . \",\" No , we don't , especially the elder people . But more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays . \",\" I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in China now . \",\"Excuse me , is this where I can catch a bus to the museum ? \",\" Yes , you're at the right stop . \",\" Thank you . \",\" Are you new here ? \",\" Yes . \",\" Have you got small change ? They require exact fare . \",\" Yes , I've got some coins . How much is the fare ? \",\" One yuan . When you get on the front of the bus , just drop your money into the box . \",\" I see . How often does this bus run at this time of day ? \",\" It runs every ten minutes . Oh , here comes the bus . \",\"May I know where you are going ? \",\" Yes . I want to go to Beijing Hotel . \",\" I'm sorry . You are going in the wrong direction . \",\" Oh no ! What shall I do ? \",\" Don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass . The bus stop is right there . \",\" Thank you very much . \",\" My pleasure . \",\"Here we are on the train . \",\" Yes , we are travelling at rush hours . It could be very crowded in the morning and after 6 o'clock in the afternoon . \",\" I hear many people have cars . \",\" Yes , almost all the families have their own cars . \",\" Why don't they drive ? Isn't a car more convenient than the subway ? \",\" Well , it is hard to find a parking place in the city . Besides , parking is quite expensive in the downtown . \",\" I see . \",\"Good coming , sir . \",\" Good morning . \",\" Would you mind moving to the middle of the bus ? \",\" Of course not . But I don't know when to get off . \",\" Where are you going ? \",\" I'm going to Wangfujing . \",\" Don't worry . I'll let you know when we get there . \",\" Thank you very much . \",\"How much is the fare ? \",\" Three yuan . \",\" Could you tell me how to use it ? \",\" You put it in the slot at the turnstile and then push the turnstile to get into the platform . \",\" Oh , I see . By the way , how can I get out of the platform after I get off the train ? \",\" That's very easy . The exit is always open . \",\" Thank you for your help . \",\" My pleasure . \",\"May I try on this pair of shoes ? \",\" Of course . What is your size ? \",\" I think it's 35 . \",\" OK . I'll get it for you . \",\" Hmm , I don't feel very comfortable . \",\" Try this one , please . This is made of real leather and is very soft . How is it ? \",\" This is just right for me . I'll take this one . \",\"Can I see some men's watches ? \",\" Of course . How about this one ? \",\" What functions does this watch have ? \",\" It's a luminous watch with a time-reminder function . \",\" Is it waterproof ? \",\" Yes , and it comes with a worldwide guarantee . \",\" I'll take it . Please set the watch for me . \",\"Let's go to the cinema by bus . \",\" Better take the subway . It's far quicker and more convenient . \",\" OK , it will be a new experience for me . \",\" We have a rather comprehensive subway system here . You can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway , especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy . \",\" Where do we pay the fare ? \",\" Just give the man sitting there three yuan and he'll give you a ticket . \",\" Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ? \",\" No , you don't have to . Here comes the train . Be careful ! Subway doors open and close automatically . \",\"May I help you , sir ? \",\" I'd like to buy a shirt . \",\" What color do you want ? \",\" I prefer the blue one . \",\" What size are you ? \",\" I'm not sure . Could you measure me , please ? \",\" No problem . I think 40 will be fine for you . \",\" Can I try it on ? \",\" Of course . The fitting room is this way , please . \",\"Would you please show me the necklace in the window ? \",\" Is this the one you want ? \",\" No , the one next to it . \",\" Here you are . \",\" Thanks . What kind of stone is this ? \",\" It's a ruby . It is from South Africa . Would you like to try it on ? \",\" Yes , please . How much is it ? \",\" It costs $ 200 . \",\" It looks good . OK . I'll take it . \",\"Let's have a look at the map first . \",\" All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here . \",\" Let's buy some tickets . \",\" The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train \",\" Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ? \",\" No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them . \",\"What would you have ? \",\" I'll try Chinese wine . \",\" What about this dry red ? It's good indeed , it never goes to the head . \",\" OK . Give me one , please . \",\" Here it is . \",\" Thank you . \",\" I'm always at your service . \",\"May I recommend you Tsingtao beer ? \",\" Tsingtao beer ? \",\" Yes , sir . It's one of the best beers in China . \",\" Really ? \",\" Yes . The beer is brewed by using carefully selected malts , rice , hops and natural water from the Lao Mountain . \",\" How about its taste ? \",\" Fine , sir . \",\" That sounds great . Two Tsingtao beers , please . \",\" Tin or bottle ? \",\" Tin , please . \",\" Would you like it on the rocks , sir ? \",\" No , thank you . \",\" You're welcome . \",\"Welcome ! \",\" Would you give me a bottle of beer , please ? \",\" With ice , sir ? \",\" No , ice will spoil the taste . \",\" Anything else , sir ? \",\" Yes . Something non-alcoholic , please . \",\" Fruit juice , milk or mineral water ? \",\" A glass of juice please . \",\" Coming up immediately . \",\"I'd like to reserve a table for two , please . \",\" For what time , sir ? \",\" Around 8: 30 p . m . \",\" May I have your name please , sir ? \",\" Yes , Anthony Fox . \",\" Mr . Fox , we'll hold the table for you for ten minutes . Please be sure to arrive before 8: 40 . \",\"Are you ready to order now , sir ? \",\" Yes , I'll have a steak , please . \",\" How would you like the steak , rare , medium , or well-done ? \",\" Rare , please . \",\" Would you like something to drink ? \",\" Coffee , please . \",\"Two number 3s , please . \",\" All right . What would you like to drink ? \",\" Diet Coke . \",\" Regular or large ? \",\" Regular , please . \",\" OK . Anything else ? \",\" No , thanks . \",\" For here or to go ? \",\" For here . \",\"Waitress , can I have the bill , please ? \",\" Yes , sir . How would you like to pay the bill , sir ? \",\" Do you accept credit cards ? \",\" Yes , sir . But we only accept American Express , Master card and Visa . What kind do you have ? \",\" Master card . Here you go . \",\" Wait a moment , please . \",\"Good afternoon , sir . Can I help you ? \",\" I'd like a beef-burger , a French fries and a milk shake , please . \",\" What flavor would you prefer , sir ? \",\" I'm not quite sure . What do you have ? \",\" We have strawberry , chocolate , vanilla and banana . \",\" Very well , I'll try the banana flavor . \",\" Anything else , sir ? \",\" No , thanks . That will be all . \",\"I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs . \",\" Alright , sir . You are making a good choice . Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord . \",\" What does it come with standard ? \",\" On all our new cars , the standards include \",\" Cruise control ? I don't like that . \",\" Why not , sir ? \",\" I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ? \",\" Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control . But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident . \",\" I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either . \",\" You know , sir , you don't have to use it . You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on . \",\" I suppose . And What about the sunroof ? Is that standard ? \",\" No , the sunroof is optional , sir . \",\" I see . \",\"For me , now an important question to buy an Accord is the time when I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon . \",\" Well , I can say that the new models will be here in August . If you order one now , we will have it for you in August . \",\" That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ? \",\" We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver . These are the standard colors . Of course you could specially order from various other colors too . \",\" My brother has last year's Accord . And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord . \",\" I know the color you mean . Is this it , sir ? \",\" Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ? \",\" Yes , you can . That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available . \",\" Well , I think I want to order the new Accord then . It looks like an excellent car . \",\" You have made a good choice , sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines , very reliable . \",\" Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else . The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk . \",\" Alright , sir . I will get the paperwork ready for you . Just a moment . \",\"Would you please recommend some Chinese wine ? \",\" Would you like to have a taste of Moutan ? \",\" That's great ! What comes along with Moutan ? \",\" Yes , you con order some typical Chinese dishes . For example , Roast Beijing Duck . \",\" It sounds good . \",\" Yes , it is the best of our hotel . \",\" Really ? Let me have a try . \",\" Thank you . Just a moment , please . \",\"Hello , how are you ? I am Jack . \",\" Hello , I am Amy . \",\" What brings you here ? \",\" I saw that your Corollas are on sale . \",\" Yes , it is really a good deal . $ 1,000 discount . I've never seen a sale as good as this one . \",\" Tell me about Corollas . \",\" Sure . It has 1.8 liter engine . This one comes with all power options , air condition , CD player , full size spare tire , automatic transmission and ABC . The window price is $ 17,000 , and I can give You for $ 16.000 . \",\" Sounds good . How about $ 15 , 000 ? \",\" You must be kidding ! You cannot get that price anywhere . \",\" I am serious . $ 15,000 . \",\" Can you put down a $ 2,000 deposit , and I'll talk to my manager , see what we can do . \",\" No . Just talk to your manager and let me know . \",\" Okay , I'll be right back ... Congratulations ! The manager approved the final price $ 15,000 . \",\" The price is fine if you give me free security system and free carpet mats . \",\" You are really tough . You got a deal . \",\" Thanks ! \",\"Hi ! Do you want a fill-up ? \",\" Yes , please . \",\" Which type of gas do you want ? Regular , Super , or Premium Unleaded ? \",\" What's the price difference ? \",\" Regular is $ 1.15 , Super is $ 1.25 and Premium is $ 1.39 . \",\" Just fill it up with Regular , Unleaded , please . \",\" Do you want me to check the tires and the fluids ? \",\" Yes , I would . Thanks a lot . \",\"We'd like some local-flavored pastry . Can you recommend some ? \",\" How about some Zongzi ? \",\" What is that ? \",\" Well , it's a pyramid-shaped dumpling made from glutinous rice wrapped in reed leaves . \",\" That sounds appealing . OK , we will have that . \",\" Do you want some stuffed bun ? It's delicious , too . \",\" OK . We will try some . \",\" Anything else ? \",\" No , it's enough . \",\" OK . Wait for a moment , please . I'll be back in a moment with the dishes . \",\" OK . Thank you . \",\"May I take your order ? \",\" We'd like this course for two , please . \",\" I'm afraid this course is for four persons . \",\" Well , can't you make it for two only ? \",\" I'm afraid not , sir . \",\" I see . Well , what do you recommend then ? \",\" I would recommend a soup with two or three small dishes . \",\" Right , we'll have these three . \",\" Would you like rice with your meal ? \",\" No , thanks . \",\" Thank you , sir . Just a moment , please . \",\"Are you ready to order now , sir ? \",\" Yes . \",\" Would you like an appetizer ? \",\" Yes . I'd like a crab cocktail . \",\" Would you like some soup first ? \",\" Very well . \",\" What kind of soup would you like ? \",\" I want egg soup . \",\" Have you decided on anything ? \",\" I'd like to have some meat . \",\" How about stewed-fried steamed pork ? \",\" No , thank you . \",\" Are you interested in today's special ? \",\" What is it ? \",\" Twice cooked spicy pork slices . \",\" OK . Let me try it . \",\" Anything else ? \",\" No , thank you \",\"Would you show us the menu ? \",\" Sure . Here you are . \",\" I'd like to have prawn cocktail , and tomato soup for the main course , I'd like steak with onion , with some black coffee afterwards . \",\" Sorry , tomato soup is not being served today , but we have egg soup , it's very delicious . Why don't you try it today ? \",\" It sounds good . I'll try it . \",\" Would you like to have a drink ? \",\" Well , I'll have a glass of mineral water . \",\" Anything else ? \",\" No , thank you . I think it's enough for dinner . \",\" OK . I'll be back soon . \",\"Is there a car park near the supermarket ? \",\" Yes , there is an underground car park near the supermarket . \",\" I see . Thanks . \",\"Hello , can I help you ? \",\" Yes , my engine warning light is on . \",\" How long has it been on for ? \",\" Just since today . \",\" You can still drive , without problems . \",\" It runs fine . \",\" Let's check it out . There'll be a $ 45 charge to check it over . If you fix it with us , we'll include the $ 45 into your repair . \",\" Okay . \",\" Please write down your address and phone number , and sign here . \",\" Okay . \",\" It'll be about an hour . Are you going to wait ? \",\" No , you can give a call when you have done checking . \",\" No problem . \",\"Can I help you ? \",\" Yes , my brakes are not working well . \",\" What's wrong with them ? \",\" I hear a noise and feel vibrations when step on the brake . \",\" The front brake ? \",\" I think so . \",\" What kind of car is it ? \",\" Toyota Corolla 2002 . \",\" Write down your name and address , give me the key , and I will check it out . \",\" Do you charge for checking it out ? \",\" No . \",\" How long is it going to take ? \",\" About half an hour . \",\" I'll wait . \",\"May I have your order , please ? \",\" Yes , I'd like to have a share of steak . \",\" OK . How do you like your steak , do you like it rare , medium or well done ? \",\" I like it well-done , please . \",\" Anything else ? \",\" One Whisky . \",\" It will be ready right away . \",\"Do you eat a lot of healthy food ? \",\" Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind . \",\" You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . \",\" What's special about these things ? \",\" Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . \",\" Thanks .

Wow , look at her , she can certainly get down , can't she ? \",\" She sure can . Are you jealous , Leslie ? \",\" A little , I wish I could do that . \",\" You can ! With a little practice . \",\" Look at him , he's buff . \",\" I think he's hot too . \",\" How do they all get in such tiptop shape ? \",\" Exercised over and over .

I can stay there for hours . \",\" Do you often go there alone ? \",\" No , I often go there with my friends . \",\"A report says running red lights causes one thousand traffic accidents every year . \",\" It ' s horrible . Why do drivers run a red light then ? \",\" Maybe they know they shouldn ' t run a red light , but when they are driving they don ' t pay enough attention to traffic lights . \",\" Talking on the cell phone while driving is very dangerous too . It increases the chance of accidents . \",\" I know . If a policeman catches you using the cell phone while driving , you will be fined . \",\"Excuse me , could I have a menu please ? \",\" Here you are . \",\" I want to try the local specialty .

Do you have a vegetarian menu ? \",\" The vegetarian dishes are at the last pages of the menu . \",\" Oh . I see . I would like to have mashed potatoes and chocolate pudding . \",\"What's the specialty of your restaurant ? \",\" The crab soup is quite delicious.It ' s always a favorite with our customers . \",\" I'm afraid I don't like seafood quite well . Would you suggest some others ? \",\" Well , why not try Spaghetti Bolognese ? \",\" OK . I will follow your advice . \",\"Steven , I am ready for breakfast . \",\" OK . But where is my favorite coffee ? \",\" It's in that pan there . Your boy Dean broke the silex yesterday , so I have to boil it in the pan . \",\" It tastes like crankcase oil , but delicious . \",\" That's good . You can make breakfast yourself if you don't like it . \",\" What is there besides coffee ? \",\" I warmed a couple of snails , and your eggs are in the frying pan . \",\" Oh , my God . It's nearly eight , I have no time to have breakfast now . My watch says seven fifty . \",\" Don't worry . It's only ten to seven . You must have forgotten to set your watch back . \",\" Yes , it was . The clock on the wall says eight to seven . \",\" Yeah . Keep on eating your breakfast . You can catch the early bus . \",\" Gee . I could have slept another hour . \",\"Would you please bring us a menu ? \",\" Sure . What would you want to have today , Chinese food or western food ? \",\" Western food . \",\" Here is the menu . Take your time . \",\"May I take yor order now ? \",\" Yes , what do you have for appetizer ? \",\" We have caviar , foiegras , lox , cold beef , sour cucumber ... \",\" Well , please bring me the cold beef . \",\" OK , sir . Do you want some soups ? \",\"What do you want to eat today ? \",\" I feel like having some dumplings . Let's go out to eat . \",\" No need ! I know how to make dumplings . Let's do it from scratch . Can you give me a hand in the kitchen ? I don't think I can finish everything by myself . \",\" Of course . What do you want me to do ? \",\" Just trim vegetables for cooking . I will cut up the meat . \",\" I can do that . And I would like to make dumplings later . \",\" Yeah , you are my good helper , Steven . \",\" Absolutely . \",\"Darling , I am back . What are you doing ? \",\" I am washing clothes . Are you hungry now ? Wait for a moment , I'll cook dinner for you . ( Steven bends his brows ) \",\" B , should we get a maid ? \",\" I can do all the housework . We don't need a maid . \",\" You have worked very hard in the office . If we can get someone to help you , you can have more rest . \",\" We really don't need to . \",\" You are a good wife , Julia . But you must take care of yourself . \",\" Give me some time to think about it . \",\"What do you think of this coffee table ? \",\" It's nice , but it doesn't match the color of our room . \",\" How about this one ? \",\" Oh no , this type gets dirty very easily and it's difficult to clean . \",\" Alright , let's look at some others . \",\" Look , this one matches our room and it's inexpensive . \",\" Moreover , it's easy to clean , right ? You are really lazy . \",\"Darling , this dress is for you . I hope you like it . \",\" Oh , very beautiful . Thank you , Steven , I like it very much . \",\" Your birthday is coming , and I think this dress suits you . Why not try it now ? \",\" My birthday present ?

How does it look like ? \",\" It displays your slender figure , darling . \",\" The most important thing is that you bought it for me . I am happy that you know my size and style . \",\" Because you are my dear wife . \",\"Excuse me , waiter , I would like to have some wine before the main course . \",\" Have you decided what wine you would like ? \",\" I have no idea . Maybe you can give me some advice . \",\" I recommend you the white wine . It will wake up your appetite . \",\" That's great , bring me a bottle of that please . \",\"I am sorry , I have broken my wine glass , and would you please bring me another ? \",\" Sure . I will clean the glasses for you . \",\" Thank you . Where is the washing room ? \",\" Walk straight and turn left . \",\"I want to keep a pet , but I don't know which one to buy ? \",\" Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day . \",\" Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then . \",\" What about cats ? They are more independent . \",\" Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat . \",\" How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ? \",\" Yeah , are they easy to look after ? \",\" Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything . \",\"What's the chef's specialty ? \",\" It's fried sole . \",\" Bring me one and besides , I would like to have a chicken cream soup . \",\" Sure . Please wait for a moment . \",\"Would you like to order now ? \",\" Yes , can you recommend some steak ? \",\" Sure . I think pepper steak is quite good .

We accept credit cards and cash . \",\" Well , I'd like to pay by cash . \",\" OK . ( A few minutes later ) Sorry to keep you waiting . Here is your change . \",\" Thanks . \",\" My pleasure . Welcome to our restaurant next time . \",\"May I take your order ? \",\" I would like to have shelled shrimps with cashew nuts . \",\" Anything else ? \",\" Strawberry cake as dessert , please . By the way , could you serve my main course without garlic and put less ginger in it . \",\" No problem , sir . \",\"Could you recommend something to drink ? \",\" Well , since you have order the roast chicken . I suggest you to order the red wine to go with the main course . It can help you digest the food . \",\" We would also like some alcohol before the main dish . \",\" I think whiskey will be a good choice . \",\"Waiter , please bring me some toast . \",\" Sure . What kind of toast do you like ? \",\" Pardon ? \",\" We have white toast , whole wheat toast and rye toast . \",\" I see , bring me the whole wheat toast . \",\" Anything to drink ? \",\" Milk , please . \",\"Bring me some toast , please . \",\" Would you like butter or jam on your toast or do you just want it plain ? \",\" Spread some jam , please . \",\" Anything to drink ? \",\" Black coffee is fine . \",\"Welcome , sir , what can I do for you ? \",\" I want to buy some records . \",\" Whose record do you want ? \",\" Are there the records of Michael Jackson ? \",\" His records have been sold out .

Maybe I should go to other video stores to have a look . \",\"What would you like to order , sir ? \",\" I'd like to try some Chinese food . \",\" We serve different styles of Chinese food here . But I'm not sure which one do you prefer . \",\" I have no idea . Could you recommend some to me ? \",\" Well . Cantonese food is rather light , Beijing food is heavy , and Sichuan food is usually hot and spicy . \",\" Oh , I see . I'd like to have hot food . \",\" If so , I suggest you have a taste for Sichuan food . Most Sichuan dishes are spicy and hot , but they have different tastes . \",\" Really ? So do you have some specialties ? \",\" Yes . Roasted Crispy Chicken and Spicy Beef are our specialties . \",\" All right . I'll have them . \",\"Excuse me , I ordered the well-done steak , but this one is so tough . \",\" Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now . \",\" I think you should be more careful next time . \",\" Yes , sir .

Maybe you should do it too . You may not get enough vitamins from your food , you know . \",\" But , I don't believe in taking pills to get enough vitamins . \",\" How's that . \",\" Because it's better , easier and cheaper to get them from the food we eat . \",\"What kind of breakfast do you want ? \",\" Is there any difference ? \",\" Yes , a continental one contains eggs , bacon , toast and juice . American one is the same as a continental one except the egg . \",\" I think I would like the former one . \",\"What are you going to take ? \",\" Roast pork chops with a bottle of red wine , please . Is soup served here ? \",\" Of course . What kind of soup do you like ? Clear or thick ? \",\" Clear soup . I think tomato soup is fine . \",\"Hello ! Can I help you ? \",\" Today is my wife's birthday , so I want to buy a bouquet for her . \",\" What kind of flowers do you want ? \",\" I have no idea . \",\" How about rose ? It's the most suitable one for lovers . \",\" But rose is too common . \",\" Well , what about violet ? It means the eternal beauty . \",\" It looks good . Pack me a bouquet of violet , please . \",\"May I order , please ? \",\" Of course . \",\" I would like sirloin steak and tomato salad . \",\" Do you take dressing on your salad ? \",\" Yes , blue Cheese please . \",\"How do you like the food ? \",\" It tastes really great .

Do you want to buy the used goods ? \",\" I'm considering buying a second-hand computer for I'm short of money now . \",\" You know the car I'm driving , which is still in good condition though it is second-hand . And it only cost me 300 dollars . It was so cheap . \",\" But do you really mean that the second - hand goods are just as good as the new ones ? \",\" It depends . So you must be careful buying second-hand goods . \",\"Is there anything I can do for you ? \",\" Excuse me , can I change my order ? I am afraid I don't have so much time to enjoy my dinner . \",\" I am sorry , sir . Your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can't change it . \",\" That's all right . \",\"Do you have desserts ? \",\" Yes , we have many kinds of pies and puddings . \",\" Can you give us more information ? \",\" Sure .

What happened ? \",\" You are not going to believe this . Do you remember the dress we saw at Mayors that was so beautiful and expensive ? I got it today at half price . \",\" So they have started the year end sale earlier this year . \",\" How can you stay so calm ? Aren't you going to take a look to see if there is anything for you ? \",\" I guess I'll wait a few more days . There maybe even bigger discount then . \",\" But there won't be anything good left . \",\"Wow , what a cool car ! The styling of this car really appeals to me . \",\" Yes , this is a very popular car . \",\" I want to buy it . How much does this car cost ? \",\" The car is beautiful , isn't it ? Come on inside and we'll discuss the price . \",\" You can tell me here . I just want to know the price . \",\" 50000 yuan ' What a deal ! That will , of course , include tax , licence , and registration fee . \",\" I appreciate your help , but I think I'll look around a bit . \",\" Then what price would be fair to you ? \",\" I think that 30000 yuan would be fair for this car . \",\" I can see that you are a smart buyer . Forty thousand is my best price . \",\" Can't you make it cheaper ? I still can't afford the car . \",\" 38000yuan is my final offer . \",\" Hum ... OK . I will take it . \",\"Welcome , sir . What can I do for you ? \",\" May I have a look at that china tea set ? It is extremely beautiful . \",\" You've made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual . It was made in Jingdezhen . \",\" Jingdezhen ? Oh , I know it . Isn't it called the capital of porcelain ? \",\" Yes , sir . \",\" Oh , it must be very precious . Is it breakable ? \",\" No , if you take some care when you use them . \",\" How much is it ? \",\" Two thousand . \",\" Oh , it is beyond my purse . \",\"Are you ready to order , sir ? \",\" Yes , I would like a roast duck and my friend wants steaks . \",\" How do you like your steaks ? \",\" I'd like it medium-well . \",\" OK , sir , wait a minute . \",\"What do you like for dessert ? \",\" Do you have trifles ? \",\" Yes . \",\" Please bring me some trifles and apple pies . \",\" OK . I will bring it for you . \",\"Good morning , sir . Could I be of any service to you ? \",\" Have you got any Chinese paintings ? \",\" Yes , we have landscape paintings , figure paintings and flower-and-bird paintings . \",\" I'd like a flower-and-bird painting . \",\" Good . How about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? It was painted by a famous Chinese painter in King Dynasty . \",\" Oh , they look just like live cranes . I like this picture very much . How much is it ? \",\" One thousand dollars . \",\" It's a lot of money . But the picture is excellent , I'll take it . \",\"You ran the stop sign . May I see your driver's licence , please ? \",\" Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't see the stop sign at the corner . I didn't mean it . \",\" That doesn't justify your violation . May I see your licence , please ? \",\" Oh , sorry , I don't have it on me . Honestly , I forgot it at the house . But I have the insurance policy with me . Here it is . \",\" Well , sir , your insurance looks good , but I still have to write you a ticket . \",\" I understand , officer . I guess it's just not my day today . I will accept the fine . \",\"Do you see that small white car over there ? It ' s Tom ' s new car . \",\" Oh , my God . It ' s beautiful . But it looks expensive . \",\" It is very expensive . Tom ' s father paid for it . \",\" I want to have a car like that . But I am not rich . And I don ' t have a rich daddy . \",\" They are By new models now , they are not very expensive . Maybe you should look for one . \",\"Excuse me , I'm afraid you've parked in the wrong spot . \",\" Oh , really ? Isn't this spot C408 ? \",\" No , it's D408 , my parking space . I have already paid for it . \",\" I'm sorry , I must have been confused . I had thought it's C section , but actually it's D section . I'll move my car right away . \",\" It's no big deal . Thank you . \",\"Hi , Bob . I heard that you had passed your driving test . Is it true ? \",\" Yes . A few days ago I have no right to get a driving licence . But now I get it . \",\" Is the driving test difficult ? \",\" Yes , it can be quite tough . Many people fail to pass the test at the first time . \",\" What does the driving test require ? \",\" You should enroll in driving school and then take a road test and a written test . After you pass both tests , you'll get your licence . \",\" Oh , I see . I need more practice before I take the driving test . \",\" Don't worry about your driving test . I think you will pass the test and get the driver's licence very soon . \",\" Hopeful ! Thank you . \",\"Have you decided on something ? \",\" Yes , please bring us two steaks . \",\" Sure . Anything else ? \",\" What vegetables come with the steaks ? \",\" Potato chips and French dressing . \",\"Can I help you , sir ? \",\" Yes . Fill it up , please . \",\" OK . What kind of gas do you want ? \",\" I don't really know . I have just bought this new car . And it's the first time I've gotten gas for it . \",\" We have regular , super , and premium gasoline . This is a new car , so I'd recommend premium . \",\" Premium , please . Thanks . Please fill it up . \",\" All right , sir . You will park at refueling 4 . \",\" OK , thanks . \",\" Your car's ready . \",\" Good . How much does it come to ? \",\" Ten gallons of premium . That's $ 18.56 , please . \",\" OK . Here you are . \",\" Thank you , sir . Have a nice drive ! \",\"Everything is OK now , doctor . \",\" That was quick work . Let me have a look at it . Yeah , everything looks fine now . Thank you very much . \",\" You are welcome , doctor . \",\" How much do I owe you ? \",\" The total is 87 dollars . Here is the bill . \",\" Really ? You worked here for just half an hour . I consider the price very high . \",\"Have you made up your mind ? \",\" Not yet , can you recommend me some chickens ? \",\" We have roast chicken , grilled chicken , chicken curry and chicken chops . \",\" Please bring me the chicken chops . \",\"Sir , here is your curried beef . \",\" Well . I am afraid you have made a mistake . It's not the dish I ordered . \",\" Let me see , I am sorry . It's for table 11 . \",\" It doesn't matter . \",\"Waiter , we have been waiting for 20 minutes . Would you mind hurrying ? \",\" I am sorry , sir , the fish you ordered will take a longer time because we make it with fresh fish . \",\" That's fine . Would you please bring me some wine ? \",\" Sure , is dry white wine OK ? \",\" Yes . Thank you . \",\"How do you like you dishes today ? \",\" Not so delicious as before , but it's fine . The soup is tasty but the meat is a little tough . \",\" I am sorry for that . We will improve the dishes next time . \",\"Do you like the food here ? \",\" Yes . The baked fish was out of this world . \",\" I am glad you like it . \",\" Can we have the bill now ? \",\" Sure . It's $ 100 . \",\"Steven , what are you thinking about ? \",\" Oh , you know , tomorrow is Vicky's birthday . I am thinking what gift to give her . \",\" That's easy . A girl at her age must like beautiful ornaments . How about a hair pin ? \",\" It's a bad idea . Vicky has short hair . \",\" Well , what about a brooch ? \",\" Only old women like that . \",\" Maybe you should ask her what she wants for her birthday . \",\" OK . That's what I can do . \",\"You sure are buying a lot of things online . \",\" Yes , I ordered a camera and some personal care stuff online yesterday . They will be delivered in two weeks . \",\" What are the advantages of buying online ? \",\" Sometimes you can save money and you can find things that you had difficulty finding in a store . sometimes it's just convenient , like doing it late at night and sometimes it's just fun . \",\" The idea of doing it at night is interesting . Maybe I'll try it some day . \",\"Good afternoon , how may I help you ? \",\" Hi , I'd like to order some flowers . \",\" Who are they for ? \",\" They're for my Wife . Her name is Samantha . \",\" What kind of flowers would you like ? \",\" I don't know . I don't know too much about flowers . Can you recommend something ? \",\" OK . What's the reason you are sending her flowers ? \",\" Today's her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers . \",\" Do you know what kind of flowers she likes ? \",\" I'm not sure . I know I should know that , but I can't remember right now . \",\" Well , they're for your wife , so I think you should give her roses . \",\" Roses will be fine . \",\" What color ? \",\" I think red would be nice . \",\" Do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them ? \",\" Can you deliver them , please ? \",\" What's the address ? \",\" 241 Main street . \",\"Let's have lunch together today . \",\" It's a good idea . \",\" I want a Hamburger and ice cream . What about you ? \",\" I don't like Hamburgers . They have no taste . \",\" What about cheese cake or apple pie ? \",\" Maybe I want an apple pie . \",\"Waiter , the dish is cold to eat . Could you please heat it up for me ? \",\" Sure . Wait a moment . \",\" By the way , I would like some chilli oil . \",\" OK . \",\"Is there a sofa in the living room ? \",\" I am afraid there isn ' t . \",\" That ' s too bad . Is there a desk in the living room then ? \",\" There is a desk and two chairs . \",\" Where are the chairs ? \",\" They are behind the door . \",\"That dog has white long hair . It ' s lovely . \",\" She is my dog . I like her very much . \",\" What ' s her name ? \",\" Her name is Fluffy . She is a sweet dog . \",\" My dog has spots . He is very strong . \",\" But I don ' t like big strong dogs . \",\"May I take your order ? \",\" What's the specialty of the house ? \",\" The baked fish in tomato sauce is pretty good . \",\" I like fish . Please bring me an order of that . \",\" Do you want some dessert ? \",\" Apple pie , please . \",\" Single or double ? \",\" Make it two . \",\"Waiter , get me rag , please . I have just spilled my wine . \",\" Let me help you . \",\" Thank you . Please bring me some paper napkins . \",\" Here you are . \",\" I think I should be more careful next time . \",\"Hello , Steven , what are you doing now ? \",\" I am preparing a birthday party for Julia . \",\" Can I be of any help to you ? \",\" Of course , could you help to blow up some balloons ? \",\" I hate balloons . \",\" Well , would you please clean the livingroom ? You know I'm too busy . \",\" No problem . \",\"Steven , we are preparing a martial arts show for the New Year's party . Would you like to join us ? \",\" I'd love to ! But I have never learned martial arts , and there is only a month left before the New Year . \",\" That's OK . A month is enough for you to learn the basic movements . It would be great to have you with us on the show . \",\" Sounds great ! Shall I learn the actions that Jet Li did in the movies ? \",\" No . You know , there are many schools and styles of kung fu . What we will perform is a set of Chinese shadow boxing . \",\" Whatever ! I'm glad to learn something of Chinese kung fu . Thanks for asking me . \",\" Thank you for joining us ! Now let's see some pictures and know more about kung fu . \",\" Good ! \",\"Here is your bill . It's $ 60 . \",\" What's this amount for ? \",\" It's for the drinks . \",\" I see . Can I pay by credit card ? \",\" Sure . \",\"You seem to be upset . What ' s eating you ? \",\" It ' s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves \",\" Dick ? How come ? He used to be as meek as a lamb . \",\" Yes , he used to be . But now he ' s drifting off track . \",\" He must have been in bad company , or he wouldn ' t be off the beans . \",\"Professor Li , do you know where to buy art supplies ? \",\" For what ? Are you taking up painting ? \",\" No . I can't paint . I'm asking for my niece . She is really into it . \",\" Oh , good . How old is your niece ? \",\" She is eight . Actually , I'm buying a good set of art supplies for her as a birthday gift . \",\" It's a wise thing to do . Art will do a child a world of good . \",\"Do you want some dessert ? \",\" No , thank you . Check , please . \",\" Wait a moment . I will calculate it for you . Your bill comes to $ 36 . \",\" Here are $ 40 . Keep the change . That's my tip for you . \",\"Do you want to help me make the cookies , Anna ? \",\" I'd love to . \",\" First , put away your toys . \",\" OK . \",\" I'll get the flour out . \",\" Let me help you . \",\"What's on Channel 12 at 8: 00 ? \",\" If I remember correctly , there's a quiz show . \",\" Do you want to watch it ? \",\" Let's see what else is on first . \",\"Hey , Steven . What are you going to do this Saturday ? \",\" If the weather is good , I'll go to climb mountains . \",\" Are you going with your friends ? \",\" No , I'm going alone . \",\" Oh , aren't you afraid ? \",\" Of course not . For me , mountaineering is both relaxation and a hobby . \",\" I think mountaineering is an exciting sport , but a little dangerous . \",\" Yeah , you are right , but it's really interesting . \",\"Waiter , please make out the bill . \",\" OK , sir . How do you like your meal ? \",\" Quite delicious , especially the pepper steak . \",\" I'm glad you like it . It's $ 60 in all . \",\" Here is the money . \",\"Is our destination the amusement park ? \",\" Yes , I think even though we are adults , it's still a good place for us to relax . \",\" What are you going to enjoy ? \",\" I want some exciting . Which is more fun , the roller coaster or the ferris wheel ? \",\" I like neither . \",\" Come on . Here is for enjoying and exciting . \",\" OK , let me think . The roller coaster looks more fun . \",\" I like ferris wheel more . \",\" It doesn't matter . We can go to the ferris wheel later . \",\" OK , let's go . \",\"Hello , I want to order an Easy-own package . What would you recommend ? \",\" Which function do you use more , making calls or sending short messages ? \",\" About the same . But I'm looking for a job , so I have to answer the phone often . \",\" Then I recommend this package to you . You can receive all the calls free by paying just 10 yuan a month . \",\" That's good . How can I order it ? \",\" Sending a message ' KTCTWY ' to 10086 will do . \",\" Thank you . I'll have a try . \",\" You're welcome . \",\"Can I pay my bill here ? \",\" Yes , sir . \",\" How much is the charge ? \",\" Let me see ... it's $ 50 . \",\" Do you receive checks ? \",\" Sorry , sir . We receive credit card and cash only . \",\" Here is my card . \",\"Hey , Jim , you're 15 minutes late . What's up ? \",\" I got stuck in a traffic jam . \",\" Hurry up , the show is about to start . \",\" It looks like you're very interested in the circus . \",\" Yes , I love to see the animal show . \",\" I have never seen those before , but since you're so excited it should be good . \",\" I'm sure you'll love it . \",\" Okay , I will go and get some popcorn first . \",\"Dad , how can we get to the zoo ? \",\" We can take a bus there . \",\" Does this bus go there ? \",\" I think so . \",\" Let's step in , Dad . \",\" No , it's too crowded . \",\" Dad . Here comes another bus . \",\" Fine . Let's get on . Oh , no , Judy ! Get off the bus quickly ! \",\" Why ? Dad ? \",\" We got on the wrong bus . \",\"There's a question I'm not sure whether it is suitable to ask . \",\" You know that I have no secrets toward you . \",\" When you go dinner with John , who foots the bill ? \",\" Why asking that ? It's often the sort of Dutch treat . \",\"Waiter , can I have the bill please ? \",\" Wait a moment . It's $ 30 . \",\" We'd prefer separate checks . \",\" OK , one with the apple pie pays $ 18 and the other $ 12 . \",\"Hello , could I make a reservation ? \",\" Sure . At what time ? \",\" 6 o'dock in the evening . \",\" Let me see ... Sorry , sir . We are fully booked tonight . Would you mind making a reservation some other time ? \",\" Do you offer mutton hot pot at noon ? \",\" Yes , sir . \",\" Then we will come here for lunch tomorrow . \",\"Could I have a refund on this ? \",\" I'm afraid you can ' t . \",\" Then can I exchange it for something else with the same price ? \",\" Just a moment . Let me find out . Our manager Wil be here in a minute . So will you speak to him ? \",\" OK . I will . \",\"Switchboard . Which extension would you like ? \",\" Extension 1616 , please . \",\" I'm afraid the line is busy at the moment . Just hold on , please . \",\" Then , will you try extension 235 ? \",\" Certainty , sir . \",\"You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ? \",\" Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful . \",\" So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ? \",\" Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities . \",\" Do you do the same exercises every day ? \",\" No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park . \",\" Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ? \",\" It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them . \",\" Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally . \",\"Can I help you ? \",\" Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . \",\" Well , you heard right . You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . We have great discounts for students . \",\" I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . \",\" Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend-the Power Macintosh G3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . \",\" Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? \",\" Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ? \",\" History . \",\" Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your hardware first . We have a special deal on right now . I should tell you about it , as it only goes until next Tuesday . If you buy one of these fifteen-inch color monitors with a Power Macintosh G3 , you can actually get 30 percent off the usual sale price . \",\" Thirty percent ? \",\" Yes . \",\" Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? \",\" Yes . It's an excellent system . \",\" Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? \",\" Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Mcintosh and Apple are the same thing . \",\" I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . \",\" I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . \",\" What ? Are you serious ? \",\" Yes . \",\" But nobody uses Macintosh ! \",\" That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . May I ask where you're from ? \",\" Yes , I'm from Taiwan . \",\" Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . \",\" But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . \",\" There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple . \",\" Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . \",\" No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university-Asian students included-most of them use Apple . \",\" Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . \",\" You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . \",\"Okay . This trail looks the best . It's a little steep . But I'm sure it will be alright . \",\" Well . You're the tour guide , I'll follow you . \",\" ... What a stink . This place stinks like rotten eggs . \",\" That's sulphur you can smell . The whole of Taiwan is a volcanic region . That's why Taiwan has so many hot springs . It's volcanic activity.The sulfur smoke that you can smell is coming from those fumaroles over there . \",\" Suddenly the ' great outdoors ' isn't so appealing . Let's hike a little faster ... \",\"What would you like for your main dish ? \",\" Steak , please . \",\" How would you like it ? \",\" Medium rare , please . \",\" Anything else , sir ? \",\" May I have a glass of red wine , please ? \",\" Of course . \",\"Excuse me . Can you take me to the airport ? \",\" Which airport , ma'am ? \",\" Kennedy Airport . \",\" All right , ma'am . Need any help with your luggage ? \",\" Thank you , but I'd rather keep this case with me . \",\"How about going swimming ? \",\" OK . Where should we go ? \",\" Why don't we go down to the pool ? It's not too far from here . \",\" Fine . I'll be ready in a minute . \",\"Hello , this is Sheila from Huawei Corp . Is that Li Lei ? \",\" Yes , speaking . \",\" I am glad to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow . Are you free tomorrow ? \",\" Can you speak a little louder ? You sound very indistinct with the hissing noise . \",\" Well , I can't hear you . \",\"Excuse me . This bus goes downtown , doesn't it ? \",\" Yes . Where do you want to go ? \",\" The Workers'Stadium . \",\" This is the right bus . \",\" Will you let me know where to get off ? \",\" Certainly.Four more stop after this . I'll call out the stops . \",\" Thank you . \",\"Anything else , sir ? \",\" That's all for now . How much do I owe you ? \",\" That'll be fifty-five dollars and twenty cents . \",\" Can't you make it a little cheaper ? \",\" Oh , no , sir . We already gave you a discount on each item . \",\" OK . I understand . Thank you . \",\"May I see that ivory horse ? \",\" Of course . \",\" It's genuine , I bet . \",\" It's made of genuine ivory , besides , it's of exquisite workmanship . The price is marked 200 yuan . \",\" I'll take it . \",\"Excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the Cross Bakery building ? \",\" The Cross Bakery building ? Oh sure . You're actually walking in the opposite direction . \",\" Oh , you're kidding ! I thought I was heading east . \",\" No , east is the other direction . To get to the Bakery , you need to turn around and go three blocks to Broadway . When you get to the intersection of Broadway and Elm , you hang a left . Go straight down that street for half a block and then you'll see the building on your left . \",\" Okay , let me see if I've got that . I need to go down Elm until I hit Broadway , then I make a left and the building is on my left hand side . Is that right ? \",\" Yeah , you've got it . Do you want me to show you the way ? \",\" Thanks for the offer , but I think I've got it . Hopefully , I won't get lost again on my way there ! \",\"Hello . Can I speak to Alice , please ? \",\" Hold on , please . \",\" Thank you . \",\" Sorry , but she's out . \",\" Would you tell her Tom Gray called ? \",\" I'd be glad to . \",\"Would you give me some fruits ? How much are these oranges ? \",\" Seventy cents a piece . \",\" How about this one ? \",\" Sixty cents a piece . \",\" Well , I'll take five of the seventy cent ones , and those grapefruits sweet ? \",\" Sure ! They are very fresh , first of all . We sell at a bargain , and you make a wise purchase if you buy them today . Eighty cents only , a piece . \",\" I follow you and I'll take three just for my trial . \",\" Thank you very much and anything else ? \",\" That's all.Thank you . \",\"May I help you ? \",\" Could I have a look at those pens ? \",\" Certainly . These are thirty yuan each and these are twenty-five . \",\" Have you got anything a bit cheaper ? \",\" How about these ? They are nine yuan each . \",\" No , they're not quite what I want . Sorry to trouble you . \",\" Not at all . \",\"Can I have my money back on this skirt ? \",\" Anything wrong with it ? \",\" Yes , this is defective . See ? I didn't notice this hole when I bought it . \",\" Oh , I'm very sorry about that . You can change it for another one if you prefer . \",\" If you have exactly the same one-same color , same design , and same size , of course . \",\" This one is the same size and color . But the design is different . \",\"What can I do for you ? \",\" Do you have any blue shirts ? \",\" Yes . What's your size ? \",\" I'm not familiar with American size . \",\" All right . Let me see . I think you'd wear a size 8 . This shirt is size 8 . \",\" It's pretty . May I try it on ? \",\" Sure . The fitting room is over there . \",\" Thank you . \",\"I often see some ' new age people ' show off their various skills to handle a skateboard , which makes me wonder in awe . \",\" Annie , you also know the ' new age people ' . I think these people must have undergone much sufferings of flesh in order to ride skillfully . \",\" Although it is easy to ride , the condition of the road surface should also be paid attention to , such as places being put together and full of gullies . If the condition permits , it is better to be equipped with helmet , eye shades , ankle shield , knee shield and elbow shield . \",\" The skateboard does not pollute the air , either . It can be used as a tool to ride instead of walk . \",\"Have you got any outdoor interests ? \",\" Yes . My only recreation is skateboarding . \",\" Oh , I know it . It is included in extreme sports . I think it's too dangerous for me . \",\" Maybe . But it emphasizes participation and a spirit of courage , and can give one the extreme sense of cheerfulness and success . I'm getting to like the game more and more . \",\"Do you want to buy something here ? \",\" These shoes are great ! What is the price of this ? \",\" This one is two hundred yuan . \",\" That's too much ! \",\"What do you want to do tonight ? \",\" I don't know . What do you want to do ? \",\" I have no idea . Do you think we're in a rut ? \",\" What do you mean ? \",\" Well , we do the same things every weekend . We go to the same restaurants . We see the same friends . You know what I mean ? \",\" Yeah , I guess you're right . It's easy to get bogged down in the day to day , and forget to change things up once in a while . Let's break out and do something completely different tonight . \",\" Okay , I'll look in the events section of the paper to see what's going on tonight . Hmm , we could go to a concert . There is a good one tonight . I bet it's not sold out . But , we'll have to drive an hour to the venue . \",\" An hour ? That's a bit of a bummer . Let me take a peek and see what else there is . How about going dancing ? We haven't done that in a while . There's a club in Silver Lake that's supposed to be hopping on Friday nights . Eddie from work told me that they have a really good DJ and a big dance floor , and the cover charge isn't bad . \",\" I'm not really in the mood for dancing , actually . You know what ? I just feel like staying home tonight and vegging , after all . How about you ? \",\" Yeah , I was hoping you'd say that . It's nice to have the option to go out but I'd rather stay in . Maybe we can go out tomorrow night . \",\" Yeah , definitely , tomorrow night . \",\"What kind of permanent would you like to have ? \",\" What kinds do you have ? \",\" Oh , we have quite a regular , cold perm , straight perm , pin curl and foam . \",\" Last time I tried a pin curl perm and a foam permanent . Set the wave a little looser than usual , please . \",\"I think Yoga might be suitable for me . \",\" Why ? \",\" Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up . \",\" But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too . \",\" I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight . \",\" You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit . \",\"What are you waiting for ? Get on that bus quickly . \",\" But where do I get a ticket ? \",\" On the bus . The driver collects the fares . You'll have to take your luggage on board . \",\" Oh , I wish I didn ' t have so much to carry . \",\"Do you carry black ink ? \",\" The ink should be next to the paper clips and thumb tacks in the stationary section , sir . \",\" I've looked for , but I didn't see any black ink . \",\" Then I'm afraid there's none in stock . \",\" Well , I'll settle for blue-black . I'll also take a dozen airmail envelopes . \",\" They come in packages of ten or twenty . \",\" Give me a package of twenty , then . And where do I find shoelaces ? \",\" On counter three . \",\" Thank you . I never can find my way around this store . \",\" I know . It took me three weeks , and I work here . \",\"Excuse me , which one is of the highest quality here ? \",\" This one . It is of the best quality and excellently tailored as well . You may try it on . \",\" That is nice . But I don't quite like the collar . \",\" The collar ? It is just the collar that is popular with young people in Shanghai . \",\" I don't care what others wear . How much is it ? \",\" 250 Yuan . \",\" Really ? Too expensive . I don't think I can afford it . \",\" But it is really worthwhile . \",\" OK , anyway , let me have it . \",\" Here you are . \",\" Thank you . \",\"Excuse me , which way is to the post office ? \",\" The post office ? Sorry , I'm not sure . \",\" Well , thanks anyway . \",\"Next , please . Where to , sir ? \",\" A one-way ticket to Chicago , please . \",\" How many did you say , sir ? \",\" One adult , please . \",\" That will be six dollars . Out of ten-seven , eight , nine , ten . Thank you . \",\"I'm interested in Chinese antiques . \",\" We have a great variety of Chinese antiques . Besides , we have landscape painting , figure painting and flower-and-bird painting . \",\" I'd like a flower-and-bird painting . \",\" How about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? It was painted by a famous Chinese painter in King Dynasty . \",\" Oh , they look just like live cranes . \",\" And what is more , in traditional Chinese thinking , cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity . \",\"What did you say your stop was ? \",\" Fifth Avenue . \",\" Oh , then you should have gotten off at the last stop . \",\" I should have ? \",\" But don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and walk back . It's not far . \",\"Mary , come here . I've found the book our teacher recommended us to buy last week . \",\" Really ? How much is it ? Oh , it's 42 yuan ! How expensive ! \",\" You know , it is the best seller for this year . It has had its fifth impression since its publication early this year . \",\" How come ? I have never seen such a popular book before . \",\" Wait a minute . I found there were two printings . The paperback books must be much cheaper . \",\" You are right . Let's buy the cheaper one . \",\"Excuse me . Is this seat taken ? \",\" No , it isn't . \",\" Am I on right bus to Chicago ? \",\" Oh , no . This is going in the opposite direction . \",\" Oh , my God ! \",\" I suggest you get off at the next stop and ask again at the station . \",\" I will . Thank you . \",\"Excuse me , where is the Beijing Railway Station ? \",\" You can take the subway to get there . \",\" How long will it take to get there ? \",\" It takes only ten minutes . \",\" May I take a bus or a taxi to get there ? \",\" You can take No . I bus or a taxi . \",\" Excuse me , sir . Where is the No . 1 bus stop ? \",\" Please turn right at the traffic lights . \",\" Thank you very much . \",\"Excuse me , can you tell me where Main Street is ? \",\" Turn left at the second light and then go straight for two blocks . \",\" Is it far ? \",\" No . It's only a five-minute walk . You can't miss it . \",\" Thanks a lot . \",\" You're welcome . \",\"What's the fare , please ? \",\" Twenty dollars and sixty cents . \",\" What ? You're overcharging me ! \",\" No way . Look . That's what the meter says . \",\" Then something must be wrong with the meter . \",\"What can I show you ? \",\" Do you have this shirt in a small ? \",\" Let me check . Yes , we have . \",\" May I try it on ? \",\" Sure . Let me help you . \",\"Do you think I should join the basketball team , Mary ? \",\" Why not ? If I were you , I certainly would . \",\" But I'm afraid it'll take up too much of my time . \",\" As the saying goes , work while you work , play while play . All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy , you know ? \",\" Hmm , you're right . \",\"Hello , Oriental Hotel . \",\" I'd like to speak to Michael Baker , please . \",\" I'm sorry , Mr . Baker is not in . May I take a message ? \",\" Yes.Tell him Mr.Cook called and ask him to return my call soon as he gets back . \",\" All right , Mr . Cook . I'll have Mr . Baker call you back as soon as he gets here . \",\"Excuse me , could you lend me some of your records ? \",\" Until when ? \",\" Until Monday or Tuesday next week . \",\" No problem . \",\"I was wondering if you'd let me stay here for a few days . \",\" It really depends on when and how long . \",\" Until next weekend , if that's OK . \",\"Would you mind doing something for me ? \",\" I would if I could . \",\" Will you please explain the meaning of this word ? \",\" Yes , with pleasure . \",\"Hello , Elizabeth . How are you ? \",\" Fine , thanks . \",\" Are you sure you're all right ? You look a bit worried today . Is anything wrong ? \",\" Well , yes , there is something wrong actually . Perhaps you can give me some advice . \",\" Of course , if I can . \",\" Well , last night when I returned from the theatre , I found that I'd lost my wallet . \",\" Oh dear ! That's terrible ! What was in your wallet ? \",\" Well , some money . of course , my visa , all my identity cards and some photos . \",\" Well , if were you , I'd go to the police station straight away and report it . \",\" Yes , I've already done that , and they said they'd look for it . But we're leaving soon and I need my visa and identity cards badly . \",\" Oh dear ! What a pity ! Are you sure you lost the wallet in the theatre ? \",\" Yes , quite sure . \",\" I think you should put an advertisement in the China Daily , saying when and where you lost it . \",\" But that takes too long . \",\" Wait a minute ! My uncle lives in Beijing and he lives very close to the theatre . I'll telephone him and ask him to go there to inquire about it . You'd better have breakfast now and I'll meet you later . \",\"Excuse me . Will you please keep an eye on my suitcase ? I just want to make a phone call . \",\" Certainly , but will it take long ? \",\" No , I'll be right back . \",\" OK . I'll look after it then . \",\"Is there anything I can do for you ? \",\" I'm looking for a black , leather bag . \",\" How's this ? \",\" I'm just looking . \",\" If you need any help , let me know . \",\"Can I help you ? \",\" How much is this pen ? \",\" Ten Yuan . \",\" And how much is this pencil ? \",\" One Yuan . \",\" Here's fifteen Yuan . \",\" And here's your change . Please check if it is correct . \",\" OK , that's right . \",\" Welcome to come again . \",\" OK . \",\"Last night I looked for my Indian classmate Barbara . I found her sitting with her legs crossed and quietly practicing . \",\" Needless to say , it must be Indian Yoga . \",\" Mary , you say something about it . \",\" Tracing back , Yoga has a very long history . It was originated before India had approved Yoga and these documents were arranged and written according to the contents passed by mouth to mouth . In other words , Yoga is passed down from ancient times , which cannot be recalled . \",\"Can I help you ? \",\" Yes , I'd like to have a look at the 2 - piece suit . \",\" What size do you wear ? \",\" Middle size \",\" Then please look at this suit . \",\" Does this suit come in other color ? \",\" Yes , we have some in blue , green , black and brown . \",\" How much is the brown one ? \",\" US $ 138 . \",\" Then I'll take it . \",\"Welcome to our shop . It seems you are interested in this dress . \",\" Yes . But I am afraid it is too thick to wear in summer . \",\" That's no problem . It is made of linen , so you won't feel hot in it . I can assure you it is of superior quality . What is more , it is very popular with young women . \",\" How much is it ? \",\" 88 Yuan . \",\" OK , that is reasonable . I will take it . \",\"You're made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual . \",\" Where was it from ? \",\" It was made in Jingdezhen . \",\" Jingdezhen ? Isn't it called ' the capital of porcelain ' ? \",\" You are right . \",\" This is the very thing I've been dreaming of . \",\" It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China . \",\" It must be most precious . \",\" But it is really worth the price . \",\"Show me a smaller pair of trousers , sir . I am not that fat , you see . \",\" You've come to the right place . We've got various styles and sizes recently . How much do you measure around your waist ? \",\" I have no idea . Measure me , please . \",\" OK ! 2 Chi round . Try this one . Maybe it's of your size . \",\" ( After trying ) I'm afraid it's still too fight around the stomach . \",\" Let me check the stock . How about this one ? \",\" ( After trying ) Mm , a perfect fit . How much ? \",\" 150 Yuan . \",\" A little expensive . But I'll buy it anyway . It's hard for me to get a perfect one . Here is 200 Yuan . \",\" Here's your change , 50 Yuan . Welcome back again . \",\"Can you help me find my books ? \",\" Certainly , do you have your school schedule ? The books are arranged by course number and instructor . \",\" Oh , I see . Thank you . \",\"Say , what's you favorite sport ? \",\" Mmmm ... , it's hard to say . I like golf a lot-but I guess like skating better . \",\" Do you know how to skate , like a skater ? \",\" No , I'm strictly a spectator . I just like watching skating . It's so beautiful . \",\" Then you must know a lot about skating . \",\"Here . Keep the change . \",\" Oh , thank you very much . \",\" You're welcome . By the way , is there a pay phone near here ? \",\" Yes , there's one just on the other side of this building . Do you have any small change ? \",\" Yes , I do . Thank you . \",\"What a lovely tapestry ! Don't you think we could use one to decorate our room ? \",\" I think we can have a try . \",\" Artistic tapestry is the highest form of expression of the rug weaving art , an exquisite handicraft of superb artistry in typical Chinese style . \",\" I see . Is this the marvelous landscape in Guiling ? \",\" I think it is . \",\" Which do you prefer , the linen one , the figured dacron or the brocade ? \",\" I prefer the linen one . \",\"Where do these flower vases come from ? \",\" They are made a town nearby . The flower vases are made of porcelain and covered with tiny bamboo sticks . \",\" Are they breakable ? \",\" No . They are not only ornamental , but also useful . \",\" No wonder it's so expensive . \",\"Can I help you , sir ? \",\" You have so many antiques and Chinese paintings here . May I have a look first ? \",\" Of course . \",\" Are they genuine ? \",\" Some are genuine . But all our reproductions are clearly marked and priced . \",\"May I help you ? \",\" Yes . Fill it up , please . \",\" Premium or regular ? \",\" Regular , please . \",\" Anything else , sir ? Should I check the water and the oil ? \",\" Yes , please . \",\"May I help you find something , or are you just looking ? \",\" I'm just looking . \",\" Then take your time , please . \",\" Thank you . \",\"Ouch ! I'm hurt . \",\" Are you all right ? \",\" Yes . I'm OK . I just had a tumble . No big deal . \",\" Good . You scared me . \",\" Sorry . Can you please help me up ! I have trouble standing up by myself with the skis on . \",\" Sure . Is this your first time skiing ? \",\" Yes . I tried skiing on grass before . Not very good at it , though . \",\"Welcome to Jinyuan Shoe Town . What can I do for you ? \",\" I'm looking for a pair of white sports shoes to go with my jeans . \",\" White ? What make do you want ? Arid what size ? \",\" Adidas . Size 38 . \",\" Adidas ? They wear well . Try this pair , Size 38 , please . \",\" Yes . ( After trying ) A bit tight actually , they pinch my toes . Have you got a larger pair . Size 39 ? \",\" Okay . What about this one ? \",\" ( After trying ) Mm , this pair fits me well . I'll take it . How much is it ? \",\" You are so lucky . They are on sale today . It costs only 250 yuan . Pay at the counter over there . \",\" OK . Thank you . \",\"I saw on TV that there is an entertainment item , bungee in Beijing Longtanhu Park . Except that the height is not exiting enough . \",\" You say how high can be exciting ? \",\" The highest bungee spot in the world is located in Mount Kikicama , South Africa , which is 216 meters high . A cable car in a scenic spot in Switzerland is 160 meters high . \",\" I know that Frenchmen installed the Bungee cord between two tall buildings . \",\" It is said that Bungee was originally a grown-up ceremony of the indigenous people of New Guinea . People stood on branches of the tree , which was over 30 meters high . Their feet were fastened with canes and they jumped off from where they stood . When they almost reached the ground , they suddenly stopped to prove their bravery and express that they were able to endure the hardships of life independently . \",\" Luckily there is no such kind of ' grown-up ceremony ' any more . \",\"Do you mind if I open the window ? \",\" If you don't mind , I'd rather you didn't . I have a cold and feel chilly . \",\" Oh , that's too bad . Should I call a doctor ? \",\" I'd appreciate it if you would . \",\" OK . \",\"Are you being served , sir ? \",\" No , not yet . I just want a haircut . \",\" Will you sit here , please ? How would you like it cut ? \",\" I want it short . \",\" But it's short already , sir . \",\" I mean very short , shorter than it is now . \",\" Shall I just trim it ? \",\" No , You can cut quite a bit off . I like it to be very short all over . Do you see what I mean ? \",\" Oh , I see . You like the Chinese style , don't you ? \",\" Yes , in the Chinese style . \",\" Would you like to have a shampoo , sir ? \",\" No , thank you . \",\" How about oil or spray ? \",\" No , nothing of the kind . \",\" There ! How is that ? \",\" That's very good ! \",\"What's the postage on these letters to hongkong , please ? \",\" I'll have to check . Do you need anything else ? \",\" Yes . Five one-dollar stamps , please . \",\" That'll be 14 dollars in all . \",\"Excuse me . You can't leave your car here . \",\" Oh , but I Just want to pick up a package . It won't take long . \",\" I'm afraid you'll have to find a parking meter . \",\" Can I park here just for a second ? \",\" No , sir . I'm sorry you can't . \",\"It's your turn , sir . I'm sorry that you had to wait . Saturday is a busy day for us . \",\" I suppose so . A haircut , please . \",\" How do you want your hair cut ? Any particular way ? \",\" I'd just like a trim , and don't cut it too short . \",\" Yes , sir . How about the sideburns ? \",\" I think they only need a little trimming . \",\" Can I use the clippers ? \",\" No , don't use them , please . \",\" Oh , all right , sir . \",\" Would you trim off a bit more there , above the ear ? \",\" Don't you think it needs a little taken off on top , too ? \",\" I guess that would be better . \",\" ( Raising a lock ) About like this ? \",\" No , not that much . Now , yes , that's fine . \",\" Shave also , s ir ? \",\" Yes . \",\" How do you want your moustache trimmed ? \",\"Three twenty-five cent stamps , please . \",\" Here you are . Seventy-five cents , please . \",\" And please send this letter by registered mail . \",\" Is there anything valuable in it ? \",\" There's a check for two hundred dollars and a photograph . \",\" Shall I make out a receipt ? \",\" No , don't bother . \",\" That will be ninety-five cents in all . \",\"How can I help you ? \",\" Yes , I would like to look at some of your products . I think what I am using now does not fit me well . \",\" We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers . \",\" What do you have in foundation ? \",\" Our foundation is of very super quality . We only use the finest ingredients . It will moisturize your skin and it can protect your skin from UVA and UVB . \",\" What colors do you have in foundation ? \",\" Let me show you . We have six colors \",\" The color I use now is natural beige . How much do you sell it for ? \",\" 250 Yuan . \",\" That's expensive . \",\" What you're paying for , madam , is the ingredients . it provides a soft and perfect finish coverage with a weightless feel . \",\" I understand . I need a lipstick , too . Do you have lipsticks in red ? \",\" Of course . But I suggest you buy a lipgloss . The shining effect is in . \",\" All right . How much is it ? \",\" 45 Yuan . If you buy the two , you can get a small bottle of nail polish for free . \",\" Well , I'll take them . \",\"Hello ! Are you shopping here today ? Haven't I seen you in some flea markets and thrift shops a couple of times ? \",\" I'm just comparing prices . \",\" You should ! This thrift shop is really cheap , though , you have to pay cash here . \",\" But they don't let you have goods on approval . \",\"How did you get it ? \",\" I found it a garage sale once . \",\" What a find ! So , how much does it cost ? \",\" Well , because I like you ... ninety bucks . \",\" Ninety dollars is pretty steep . I'll take it for sixty bucks . \",\"I'd like to send this to Chicago . \",\" Air mail or surface mail ? \",\" Air mail , please . \",\" Please put it on the Scale there . Seventy five cents . \",\" Make it special delivery , please . \",\" Oh , then it'll be one dollar twenty five cents . Thank you . \",\"Would you tell me how I should send this parcel to Shanghai , China ? It contains only books . \",\" You might send it as'Printed Matter ' . \",\" I wonder if I could have it insured here ? \",\" Of course . How much would you want to insure these books for ? \",\" Let me see ... I think I can have them insured for five hundred dollars . \",\" Five hundred dollars , so you pay ten dollars for the insurance , that's two percent of the total value of the article . \",\" Here's a check for ten dollars . \",\"If you're observant you'll see rare birds , insects , butterflies , and a few reptiles . But you must look for them . There are also a few am-phibians in lower places . \",\" Well , let's move , I can see a rest area ahead.We can relax there , and see what wildlife is around ... \",\" Huh ! I am really out-of-shape , Why aren't you out-of-breath ? \",\" Because I come hiking every week . That's why I'm in good-shape . I think that I should bring you a walkingstick next time . \",\" How can you say that ? But , you could give me a piggyback the rest of the way . \",\" So , you want me to carry your backpack , your thermos flask , our picnic , and you as well . No problem , jump on . \",\"I have found it quite different here from China since I came to the United States . \",\" What's the difference ? \",\" Some friends of mine took me to the mall to go shopping . It was so big . I think I could get lost if I went there alone . \",\" You must have bought many things in the mall ? \",\" Not really many . I was told that on weekends there were always the flea markets , so I decided to come to the flea market to buy a bargain . \",\" It's wise to do it . The Americans have the habit of selling their junk when they are moving to another place , so they usually display all the things they want to sell in their gardens at the weekend . And many things they are selling still look quite new and they are also very useful . \",\" I have heard about it while in China . it is called a \\\" yard sale \\\" . I didn't have any idea of that until today when I came here to the big \\\" yard sale \\\" . \",\" You must have got many useful things for your new apartment . \",\"Does this TV work well ? \",\" Yes , it is almost new here . \",\" Is it a color TV or a black and white TV ? \",\" It is a color TV . You know , the rich people like the digital one now . So they have no room for them . \",\"Hi , is that Mr . Wu ? \",\" Yes . What can I do for you ? \",\" I am calling to query about some of your information . \",\" We've got a bad line . Can you repeat that please ? \",\" I said I want to ask about some of your information . \",\" Sorry , the connection is terrible . I'll call you back because I can't hear anything . \",\"( Bob groans . ) What's the matter.Bob ? \",\" I think it's my ankle . \",\" What happened ? \",\" One of my snowshoes got caught on a rock . \",\" Can you stand ? \",\" I don't think so.It ' s kind of sore . \",\" We'll have to get you to a hospital for an X-ray . \",\" Is that really necessary ? \",\" It may be worse than it seems . How's it feel ? \",\" About the same . \",\" Someone will be out to take a look any minute now . \",\" Should we be here , Alice ? I don't think it's that serious . \",\" Of course ! It's the sort of thing a hospital emergency ward is for . Will we have to wait much longer ? \",\" I hope not.It isn't that busy . \",\"In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off . \",\" You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord . \",\" Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage . \",\" A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , \\\" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . \\\" \",\" It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of ' comfortable ' \",\"Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot . It's so open . And just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness . \",\" You can have a bird view of Chilin City from the top of the mountain . \",\" Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing . \",\" You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the coming . \",\" No wonder people say , Even the immortals would rather be Guiliners . \",\" ... Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky . \",\" I didn't know you liked bird watching . \",\" I don't really . I just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . This place is full of it . \",\"Where are you going to play this weekend ? \",\" I have not given it much thought . Do you have any good suggestions ? \",\" I want to spend two days in the mountains with friends . The city is too noisy . Do you know Tangle Temple ? \",\" I have been there . It is in the middle of the mountains . It is not noisy there and you have to be a vegetarian . \",\" Do you want to climb the mountain with us ? \",\" Does it have enough lodging ? \",\" No problem . The temple is quite large . \",\" There are many ancient pine trees there . It is especially quiet at night . It is wonderful to listen to the monks chanting while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees . \",\" I'm getting a little excited now . What clothes should I wear ? \",\" Take some thick clothes with you . It is rather cold there at night . If you wear the T-shirt you're wearing now , you will become a ' popsicle ' . \",\" Anything else I should bring ? \",\" If you like taking pictures , you may bring a camera with you . \",\" Needless to say . \",\"Would you please weigh this letter to see what the postage is ? \",\" Do you want to send it by ordinary or registered mail ? \",\" By ordinary air mail , please . \",\" Anything of value in it ? \",\" A postal order for four hundred dollars . \",\" In that case , you'd better have it registered . \",\" Will I be informed when my friend gets the letter ? \",\" Yes , when your friend gets it , he'll sign a receipt , which will be sent to you by mail . Then you can be sure it's been received . \",\" All right , I'll have it registered , then . \",\"I need some mascara . Do you have good thickening mascara ? \",\" Of course . Here is our thickening mascara . We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes . \",\" Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too . Do you have a color chart can look at ? \",\" We have a very wide selection of colors . And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ? \",\" Oh , sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first . \",\" I can help you with that . \",\" Thank you . \",\"How can I help you ? \",\" Yes , I would like to look at some of your products . \",\" Did you have anything specific in mind ? \",\" Well , to be honest , I mostly use Sarah Winter products now . But I'm not happy with them . So I would like to change companies . \",\" Well , you made a good choice . Coming to us , I mean . We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers . \",\" What do you have in foundation ? \",\" Our foundation is very high quality , only the finest ingredients . It will moisturize your skin and it has a sun block rating of 8 . \",\" What colours do you have in foundation ? \",\" Let me show you . We have this rose colour . We also have different shoes of beige . \",\" The color I use now is rose . How much does this rose foundation cost ? The 100ml bottle . \",\" ln this size , we sell it for 53.95 . \",\" Wow ! That's expensive . \",\" What you're paying for , Ma'am , are the ingredients . It is a very high quality product . \",\" I understand . \",\"Are you interested in mountaineering ? \",\" Yes , in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you \",\" I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . I went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains . \",\" How did you spend the night there ? \",\" We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful . \",\" I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country . \",\" Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ? \",\" Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains . \",\" I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ? \",\" I'd love to . \",\"May I help you ? Miss ! \",\" Yes . I'd like to look at lipstick and eye shadow . \",\" What color set do you prefer ? \",\" Well , brown . \",\" We have a beautiful selection of eye shadows this fall . Look at the colors .

You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls . \",\" It's true . \",\" Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call . \",\" That's all ? \",\" In hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets .

Sit down and I'll get it . \",\"How much will it amount to ? \",\" Wait a minute . It's $ 80.5 . \",\" Do you receive traveler's checks ? \",\" Sorry , sir . We accept cash only . \",\"I can ' t believe these skirts are so cheap . \",\" I know and they are really nice , too . \",\" I ' ll have to get a couple in different colors . \",\" Me , too . \",\" Buy them now though , or they might not still be here tomorrow . \",\" Good idea , especially at this price . \",\"How much are these apples ? \",\" Let me weigh them for you . 1.5 $ . \",\" Do you accept coupons ? \",\" Yes . \",\" Here are my coupons . Is that enough ? \",\" You have to pay $ 0.5 more . \",\"How much altogether ? \",\" $ 40 . \",\" Do you receive cash only ? \",\" We receive credit card as well . \",\" Here is my credit card . \",\"Let's cross here . \",\" You're kidding . We'll never make it across in one piece ! Let's cross at the light . \",\" Now we have to walk all the way down to the end of the street . \",\" If you want to cross here , be my guest . I don't feel like dodging cars and scooters ! \",\"May I have my bill , please ? \",\" That's $ 20 in all . \",\" Well , I am afraid you have made a mistake . Would you check it again , please ? \",\" Let me see . I am terribly sorry , sir . That should be $ 18 . \",\" It doesn't matter . \",\"You're having coffee , aren't you ? \",\" Yes , I always have coffee in the morning . \",\" What are you going to have to eat ? \",\" I'm going to order scrambled eggs and toast . What about you ? \",\" That sounds good to me . I'll have the same . \",\"How do you like it ? \",\" It's quite good . I will take it . \",\" Sure . We can deliver it to your home . \",\" Well .

I bought the can two days ago , but today I found that is beyond the guarantee period . \",\" Let me see . I am sorry , sir . We will change another one for you . Please wait a moment . \",\"Excuse me , do you have any English songs ? \",\" Yes , we do . They are all in this book . \",\" Great , thanks . \",\" No problem . Just give us a few minutes more to pull them up , though . We don ' t get that many English singers ! \",\" Oh , I see . \",\"What fruits are in season right now ? \",\" What about grapes and water melons ? \",\" Can I sample a grape ? \",\" Sure . \",\" It tastes good .

I think I'll join you . \",\"What can I do for you , sir ? \",\" I'd like to choose one game for myself and one for my younger sister . \",\" What kind of games do you like ? \",\" Big games of course . \",\" I see , but games are played in different ways . I'm wondering what type of games do you like to play ? \",\" Type ? I don't know , what do you have ? \",\" Basically , there are 7 types of games \",\" Well , I am a beginner . I ... \",\" Don't worry . Most male customers choose first person shooting , real time strategy , action or sports , while female customers prefer simulating , action or role playing . Shooting , action and sports games require flexible movements and real time strategy usually needs overall consideration . \",\" I like first person shooting and action more than other types of games . \",\" If so , counter Strike and Might & Magic are good alternatives . Counter Strike is one of the hottest shooting games and Might & Magic series are popular among girls because the game has attractive plot and interesting scenes . \",\" Oh , thanks a lot . Then , I will take the two . \",\" Do you want the latest editions ? If your computer runs fast , I think the latest editions are better because although old editions are cheaper , they are less exciting and attractive . \",\" I will have the latest editions . \",\"Excuse me , where are the canned goods ? \",\" The counter is at the end of the aisle . They are kept in the ice chest . \",\" Thank you.And where can I buy some delicatessen ? \",\" The delicatessen department is on the second floor . \",\" Thanks a lot . \",\"What are you going to have ? \",\" I'll try a steak sandwich . \",\" Can I get you anything to drink ? \",\" Yes , I'd like a chocolate shake . \",\" That sounds good . I think I'll have the same . \",\"How much are these in all ? \",\" It comes to $ 40 . \",\" Here is my member card . Can I have someone carry those bags to my car ? \",\" Of course . I will find you one . \",\"Welcome to the McDonald's . What will it be for you , madam ? \",\" One Big Mac and French Fries . \",\" Is there anything else ? \",\" Give me one coke , please . \",\" Is this to go or to eat here ? \",\" To go , please . \",\" That comes to four dollars and ten cents . \",\" And can I have some ketchup , please ? \",\" It's on the service counter over there . Please go to help yourself . \",\"Tu Mao , I'm hungry , let's get something to eat . \",\" Me too . Is there a place nearby that we can get something to eat ? \",\" There's a Kentucky's not far ahead and there's a McDonald's in down street . \",\" Kentucky's ? Is that a chain restaurant ? \",\" Don't you know about Kentucky's ? \",\" I've heard about it , but never had one . \",\" They sell pieces of fried chicken , you've got to try one this time . \",\" OK . Let's go . \",\"Have you bought War Craft 2 yet ? \",\" Yeah ! I bought it the day it was released . \",\" How do you like it ? \",\" It's a great game . There are a lot of new characters . \",\" Did it cost very much \",\" It cost about thirty . Most games cost about that much . \",\" Mechwarrior is such a good game . The graphics are awesome ! \",\" Oh , I know what you mean . I'm addicted to that game . \",\" My roommate always wants to play it . But I told her to buy her own game . \",\" Yeah , my roommate likes to watch me play . He says it's like watching a movie . \",\" I've never seen such good graphics . \",\" And I've never heard such good sound in a game . \",\"Hi , I'm George . I'll be your waiter this evening . Are you ready to order or do you need a few more minutes ? \",\" I'm ready now . I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn . \",\" And would you like an appetizer before your meal ? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup . \",\" I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad . \",\" Can I get you anything to drink ? \",\" Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea . \",\" Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad . \",\" Thank you . \",\"All the food smells tasty today and makes my mouth water . \",\" Let's line up here . This line seems a little shorter . \",\" What's on the menu today ? \",\" Fish , beef , pork , chicken , vegetables and beancurd . For staple food we have rice , steamed bread , stuffed buns and noodles . \",\" Oh , we're lucky today , aren't we ? \",\" I'd rather take stewed cabbage with beef . \",\" I think I'll take fried fish , because fish is one of my favorites . \",\" That's good , we can share what we have . Here we are . You go ahead . \",\" ( They get everything ready ) Here is a free table . Let's sit down . Help yourself to some fish please . Isn't it delicious and appetizing ? \",\" I'm sorry I don't like it's a little too salty . \",\" I see . You people from south prefer sweet , don't you ? \",\" Yes , I like the fish cooked in sweet and sour sauce best . Try some beef , please . \",\" Thank you . I'm through with one steamed bread and I'd like a second helping . \",\" Your appetite is good . \",\" I'm always feeling hungry . \",\"Good evening , ma'am . Table for one ? \",\" Yes , please . \",\" Will this table be all right ? \",\" Actually , I'd like a booth by the window if that's possible . \",\" Certainly . How about this one ? \",\" This will be fine , thanks . \",\" ( Handing her a menu ) Your waiter will be here in a minute to take your order . \",\" Thank you . \",\"I will take the coat . Do you receive checks ? \",\" Yes , of course . \",\" Here you are . Please give me a receipt . \",\" Sorry , sir , you have to pay in the check-out counter . It's there . \",\" OK , please wrap it for me first . \",\"Excuse me , sir . Is this a duty-free shop ? \",\" Yes , you can draw your tax back at any customs in the EU . \",\" Well , I am afraid I don't bring my passport with me today . Can you save it for us until tomorrow ? \",\" No problem , sir . \",\"How about we go to the flea market today ? \",\" Great . I have long been looking forward to there . \",\" Me , too . There are so many cheap but nice things . \",\" I can't help shopping there . \",\"Garage sale , what does that mean ? \",\" Well , it is like a shop but the things here are quite cheap . \",\" How much is the tape record ? \",\" $ 5 . \",\" That's really cheap . I will take it . \",\" Sure . Here you are . \",\"Hello . May I speak to Brian , please ? \",\" Sorry , you have the wrong number . There's no Brian here . \",\" Is this 777-9345 ? \",\" No , it's 777-9344 ? \",\" Oh , I ' m so sorry . \",\" That's OK . \",\"I have read your notice on the wall so I come to see if there is anything I need . \",\" Well take your time . There are so many things to sell . \",\" How much is the desk ? \",\" $ 7 . \",\" The goods in the yard sale are really cheap .

What are you going to have ? \",\" That sounds good . I'm going to order the same thing . \",\"You're going to have coffee , aren't you ? \",\" Yes . I could use a cup of coffee . \",\" Are you going to have anything to eat ? \",\" French toast sounds good . What are you going to order ? \",\" I'll have that too . \",\"How much is the video camera ? \",\" $ 250 . It's Sony made in Japan . \",\" It is cute . I will take it . Please make out the receipt . \",\" OK , sir . Here you are . There is a one-year warranty . \",\"Excuse me , sir . I wonder if I could exchange the shoes for a larger one . \",\" No problem . May I see your receipt , please ? \",\" Here you are . \",\" That's right . Now try on this one . It's size 41 . \",\"Excuse me . I bought this shirt yesterday , but I would like to refund it . \",\" Gave me the receipt , please . \",\" Here is my receipt . \",\" What's wrong with it ? \",\" It's too small for me to wear . \",\" Would you like another bigger one ? \",\" No thanks .

These books here focus on grammar , and those are mainly for conversation practice ... Here we are . This book has short passages for students to read and answer questions about . \",\" Great . That ' s just the sort of thing I'm looking for . Thanks . \",\"A cup of coffee sounds good , doesn't it ? \",\" Yes , but I think I'll have orange juice first . \",\" Do you feel like having anything to eat ? \",\" Well , I think I'll try the pancakes . How about you ? \",\" Sounds great . That's just what I feel like having . \",\"Do you know Yahoo Greetings , Edgar ? \",\" Sure .

Choose the card which you like best , and fill in the following blanks with both your and your friend's names and e-mail addresses . \",\" Is that all ? \",\" Don't forget to send . \",\" Oh . I see . Thanks . \",\"Here's your roast chicken , ma'am . \",\" Thank you . \",\" Excuse me , waiter , could you bring me some barbecue sauce ? \",\" Certainly .

( He brings her the pie . After she finishes , the waiter comes back . ) Would you like anything else ? \",\" No , I'm stuffed . I'm ready for the check . \",\" Here you are . Thank you and have a nice evening . \",\" Thank you . \",\"Now let's use the weight machines . \",\" How about the rowing machine \",\" Great . They've all got built-in TVs . \",\" Cool ! We can watch Ally Mcneal ! \",\" But we could just stay there for 20 minutes . \",\" What exercises can I do to firm up my backside \",\" I would recommend doing some squats .

Thanks for your help . \",\" You're welcome . \",\"Excuse me , I'm looking for the Alands Morrissette album Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie . \",\" Let's see . If we have it , it should be over there under M . ( He looks through the Cds . ) Hmm , it looks like we've sold out of that one , but we should be getting some more copies in soon . If you want , we can order it for you . \",\" That's okay , I'll just check back later . Do you have the new Sting album ? \",\" Yes , it's right over here . \",\" Great . One last question , where is your jazz section ? \",\" Back there against that wall . \",\" Oh , I see it . Thanks for your help . \",\" No problem . \",\"Excuse me , I'm looking for your casual short-sleeved shirts . Can you tell me where those are ? \",\" Right over here , sir . What-size do you wear ? \",\" Medium . \",\" These here are all mediums . \",\" Thank you . I think I'll take this one , and these pants as well . They're presents for a friend . \",\" Shall I gift-wrap them for you , sir ? \",\" Yes , please . \",\"It's hot today , shall we go for a dip at the beach ? \",\" That's a good idea . Let's bring our trunks and towels . \",\" Would you like to swim in the swimming pool or at the beach ? \",\" I'd prefer the pool . \",\" OK . Let's pay the entrance fee and change our clothes in the dressing room . \",\" What style do you use ? \",\" Well , I use breast stroke for long distance , crawl or free style for short distance and back stroke just for fun . \",\"How do you usually part your hair ? \",\" To the right . \",\" ( The hair stylist cuts the customer's hair . ) Almost done . I just have to even things up a bit . ( She shows the customer the results . ) Will that do ? \",\" Looks good . \",\" Would you like a shave ? \",\" No , thanks . \",\" Okay , let me brush you off . Thank you very much for coming . \",\" Thank you . \",\"Can anyone tell me where I can buy the ingredients to make Chinese food ? \",\" There is a supermarket in Kensington High Street . I'll come and give you a hand . \",\" That is good of you . \",\" Here , take one of these trolleys . What do you want exactly ? \",\" I'm after things to stuff dumplings with , like Chinese cabbage \",\" The fruit and vegetables are over there . \",\" Pork . Where's the meat counter ? \",\" Over there . \",\"Hello , sir . What can we do for you today ? \",\" I'd like a trim . \",\" Would you like your hair washed as well ? \",\" No , thanks . \",\" Okay , have a seat over here . How do you want it cut ? \",\" Cut it short in the front , but leave it long in the back . Leave just a little over the ears . \",\" All right . \",\"I'm planning to buy a bicycle . As you are quite a cycling enthusiast , I wish you might give me some advice . \",\" With pleasure , chap . But before I start , I need to know what you want a bike for ? \",\" My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . On the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends . \",\" Cycling during weekends ? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ? \",\" Does that make any difference ? \",\" Can't be greater . If you ride on bumpy , hilly roads , a mountain bike is what you need . But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike . \",\" Are they designed differently ? \",\" A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . It's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . In contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame . You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over . \",\"This place is great . I'm surprised there are so many things here . \",\" Yes , but it takes a while to find things . It's not organized as carefully as a regular store . \",\" What's the difference between an outlet and a regular store ? \",\" Usually a clothes company will send their overstock to an outlet . The prices are very low . But you may find faulty products here too . \",\" Faulty products ? \",\" Yes . Sometimes the fault is very small ; if you have a needle and thread , you can fix it yourself . So it's a good deal to buy it . \",\" Oh , that's easy for me . I think it's really a good deal . \",\" Yes . You can save a lot of money in this way . \",\" That's great for me . Look , children's clothes ! I'd like to buy some winter clothes for my son and daughter . \",\" Why not buy the sweater ? It only costs 30 Yuan . \",\" Yes , I'll take it . Are there any jeans ? Xiaohui's jeans are always dirty . I also need four pairs of slippers . \",\" How many do you want to buy ? \",\" I ought to make the most of it while I'm here , don't you think ? \",\" You're right . \",\"You're looking very well . \",\" Thank you . I try to keep in shape . \",\" Do you often exercise ? \",\" Yes , as long as I can find the time . I like swimming best . \",\" What style of swimming do you like best ? \",\" I like the back best . I am good at freestyle stroke , but I usually use breast stroke as it keeps me from getting tired . \",\" I think butterfly stroke is the most difficult style to learn . \",\" I agree . I'm not good at it , either . Can you swim ? How about going for a swim this Saturday ? \",\" Oh , no . I am quite a stone in the water and cannot swim . \",\"Welcome to Flash Foot , sir . How can I help you ? \",\" I'd like extra prints made of these photos . \",\" Do you have your negatives ? \",\" Yes . Here they are . I've marked how many prints I want on each shot . \",\" What size do you want the prints ? \",\" Four by six , except this one . I want a ten by thirteen print of this one . \",\" Okay , they'll be ready for you in an hour . \",\"Welcome to Flash Foot . What can I do for you , ma'am ? \",\" I'd like to have this roll of film developed . \",\" What size prints would you like ? \",\" Four by six will do . \",\" All right , ma'am , they'll be ready for you in an hour . \",\"What is my ideal weight ? \",\" It depends on your height and body type . \",\" How can I avoid injuring myself during exercise ? \",\" By warming up before and cooling down after your workout . \",\" Sir , tell us about your experience with Super Bulk-up . \",\" Well , it's completely changed my life . \",\" Tell us how . \",\" Well , before , I was the skinniest guy on the beach . \",\" And now ? \",\" Just look ! In six short weeks I've put on 30 pounds of pure muscle . \",\" Wow ! All because of Super Bulk-Up . \",\"Good afternoon , ma'am . Can I help you find anything ? \",\" No , thanks . I'm just looking . \",\" We have a special on these skirts this week . Would you like to try one on ? \",\" No , thank you . I don't need any skirts . \",\" How about a blouse ? This one here is the latest fashion . \",\" No , thank you . \",\" Why not try on this lovely pair of shorts ? I'm sure they'd look fabulous on you . \",\" No doubt . Look , I'm just browsing . If I need your help , I'll let you know . \",\" Take a look at this dress . Don't you think it's perfect for you , ma'am ? Uh , where are you going , ma'am ? Ma'am ? \",\"Have you any beef today ? \",\" Yes , we've got a very tender new shipment from the mainland . It is a weekend special . \",\" How much is it a pound ? \",\" One pound and fifty pence a pound . \",\" Good . I'll get three pounds of it . \",\" Here it is . Four pounds and fifty pence in all . \",\"Have you got some nice apples in stock today ? \",\" What about these ? They are very fresh and exceptionally juicy . \",\" Are they sweet ? \",\" Very sweet . \",\" How much are they ? \",\" These are a dollar each and those are 75 cents each . \",\" All right , I'll have a dozen of the dollar ones . \",\" OK . Anything else ? \",\" Do you have any tangerines ? I'd like to have two kilograms . \",\" Yes , we've just had some wonderful tangerines in from Tailband . Here they are . \",\" How much is it in all ? \",\" Thirty dollars . \",\"What is your policy on returns ? \",\" If you bring them back with your receipt within seven days , you'll get a full refund . Also , if you need alterations to the pants , just bring them in and we'll do them for free . \",\" Sounds good . \",\" That'll be $ 70 , please . Will you be paying by cash or charge ? \",\" Charge . Here's my card . \",\" Okay , sir , here you are . Thank you very much . \",\" Thank you . \",\"I'll try one of these on . ( The customer tries one of the shoes on . ) It's too big . It slides up and down my heel when I walk around . \",\" Well , let's try a size ten . ( He gets another pair and the customer tries a shoe on ) Looks like a perfect fit . \",\" Not really . It pinches my toes . \",\" I'm sure they'll be fine once you break them in . \",\" I don't know ... well , I guess I'll take them , since you don't seem to have anything better . \",\" Thank you , ma'am . It's been a pleasure doing business with you . \",\"You look fresh recently . And .. what's your weight now ? \",\" 110 pounds . \",\" Really ? Congratulations ! That's really something beyond my imagination . How did you make it ? Did you keep on a diet ? \",\" No , you know I can't bear eating less . \",\" Then do the slim pills take effect on you ? \",\" I've quit it already . I go to aerobics class everyday instead . \",\" How's it going on ? \",\" You see . I've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite . \",\" I'd better exercise my body too . My limbs are rusty now . \",\" I don't think so . You look full of energy every day . Time has stood still with you . \",\" Thank you . \",\"Good morning . Welcome to Time After Time Watches . \",\" I'd like to buy a watch . \",\" Well , you've come to the right place . What kind of watch are you looking for ? \",\" Well , I'm not sure . Let's see . How much is this one ? \",\" Hmm ... This Rolex ? $ 1,000 . \",\" Oh . I don't think I can afford that . How about this one ? \",\" This one is $ 500 . \",\" Wow . That's too much for me . Don't you have anything cheaper ? \",\"The total cost is 850 dollars . How would you like to pay ? \",\" By credit card . \",\" We take Visa and Master Card . \",\" Do you take American Express ? \",\" No , we don't . \",\" Ok , I'll use my Visa . Here you are . \",\" Thank you ... please sign on the line . \",\"What'll it be today , sir ? \",\" Fill it up . Super Unleaded . \",\" Shall we check your oil and tires ? \",\" I just checked the oil myself , but you can check the tires . \",\" ( The attendants fill the tank , clean the windscreen , and add some air to the tires . ) All right , sir , that'll be $ 26.50 . \",\" I'll charge it . Here's my card . \",\"Let me suggest this one . It's an excellent watch , it looks good , and it's only $ 100 . \",\" Hmm . That's not too bad . Does it have a stopwatch ? \",\" Uh , no . Analog watches don't come with stopwatches . You'll have to get a digital if you want a stopwatch . \",\" Oh . I see . Where are your digital watches ? \",\" Right here . \",\" I don't like this kind as much . Never mind the stopwatch then . I'll take that other one . Do you take checks ? \",\" Yes . Make it out to Time After Time . \",\" Here you are . \",\" Thank you . \",\"May I help you ? \",\" What's the price of the bread ? \",\" 2.50 Yuan . \",\" And how much is the coca cola ? \",\" 3.00 Yuan . \",\" Here is ten Yuan . \",\" Here is your change , please . \",\" Thank you . \",\" Welcome to my shop next time . \",\"That's $ 60 in all . \",\" Here is my card . Can I have them delivered to this address ? \",\" Sure . You can go to the front desk to ask for more help . \",\" OK , thank you . \",\"Excuse me , can I order now , please ? \",\" OK , what would you like ? \",\" I'd like the lasagna , please . \",\" Sure and which one would you like ? \",\" I'll try the vegetarian , please . \",\"The skirt looks beautiful . Can I try it on ? \",\" Of course . \",\" Well , I think this one is a little too small . Would you please bring me a bigger one ? \",\" I am sorry the larger ones are out of stock now . But you might be lucky at our Branch . \",\"Is this a duty-free shop ? \",\" Yes , sir . What can I do for you ? \",\" I want to buy some specialties . Can you recommend me some ? \",\" Sure . I strongly advise you to buy a bottle of perfume and a lighter . \",\" Fine . They look nice . I will take both of them . \",\" May I have a look at your passport , please ? \",\"Ping-pong must be the top-ranking popular sport in China . It seems to me in every school , factory , army unit , or residential area , men and women , young and old , are swinging paddles . \",\" You got it ! In a sense , it has become a byword for Chinese sport . \",\" What do you think might be the source of its popularity ? \",\" I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . All you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . Tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ... \",\" And sometimes a substitute table can be made out of a few desks . \",\" Put it there ! In senior high schools , we used to play on desks in the classroom , when no vacant tables were available . Likewise , the racket may take a variety of forms , too.Anything that resembles a racket , from a plank to cardboard or even a hardcover book , may be used as a racket . \",\" Haha , these are very good inventions . All these speak the public's fondness for the sport \",\" Yeah , the sport is affordable and accessible to every Tom , Dick and Jane in this developing country . No wonder even the state leaders are known to be keen on it . \",\" I know President Hu Into likes playing ping-pong . \",\" Actually , he excels in it . Chairman Mao , too , encouraged the whole nation to play ping-pong as a part of the nationwide body building campaign . \",\" I see . There was also the famous ping pong diplomacy , wasn't there ? \",\"How do you feel ? \",\" I like the style but it is a little tight in the waist . \",\" Here is the bigger size . \",\" This one fits me well but it is too expensive , can you make it a little cheaper ? \",\"Good evening , sir . What's your pleasure ? \",\" Give me a shot of whisky and soda . \",\" With or without ice , sir ? \",\" Certainly without ice . Ice will spoil the taste . \",\" Would you like to say ' when ' , please , sir . ( Pouring soda ) \",\" Whoa , when . \",\" Enjoy your drink , sir . \",\"She's a Persian . She has papers and everything . Not like a street dog . \",\" Cats chase mice , don't they ? \",\" And bugs . They can catch anything . \",\" Do you have to walk a cat ? \",\" No , they use litter boxes or go outside by themselves.Thev ' re so smart . \",\" But then you have to change the litter box . \",\" It's better than picking up dog poop . \",\"Good evening , sir . What's your pleasure this evening ? Your usual ? \",\" Yes . I'm going to stay with the same , a beer . \",\" Certainly , a beer . Here you are , sir . \",\" Oh , darn . Look what I've done . ( Spill the drink ) \",\" Don't worry . I'll make you another on the house . \",\"I'm getting so paunchy that I'm afraid I have to buy a new belt to-morrow , and I think I must go on a diet . \",\" You are just a little bit chubby , not paunchy . \",\" You know , I'm a compulsive overeater . I got to watch what I eat . \",\" More physical exercise may help to keep your weight down . \",\" You said it . \",\"Hi . Can I help you ? \",\" No , thanks . I ' m just looking around . \",\" Okay . Please let me know if you need any help . \",\" Thanks a lot . \",\"Is this where I can catch a bus to the theater ? \",\" Yes , but you can't get there with out a change . \",\" Which bus do I have to change ? \",\" You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 . \",\" I see . Thank you . \",\"Morning , Tom ! What are you doing over there ? Learning to dance ? \",\" Can't you see ? I'm practicing tai chi ! \",\" Oh , my goodness . I'm sorry . But I don't think tai chi is to be practiced like that . \",\" I'm just a beginner . Did my poses make me the butt of jokes ? \",\" Well , they just look a bit funny . but far from making a laughing stock out of you . \",\" So , is there anything wrong with my strokes ? \",\" To begin with , you should keep your neck erect upward at any time . \",\" Like this ? \",\" Good ! And then , the entire body . Never incline your body forward or backward . Take care to regulate the point of balance . Place it at your waist . \",\" Did I do it right ? \",\" No ! You should avoid sticking out your belly . Keep your hip steady . Don't swing . \",\" What should I do with my legs then ? \",\" Oh , yes , things are quite different with the limbs . Keep your knees bent a little . Right , they should be rich in elasticity . Move slowly when you shift your centre of gravity from one leg to another . \",\" Fantastic ! I guess the same is true with the arms , right ? \",\" Exactly ! Move your arms in a relaxed manner . Well . don't stretch yourfingers stiffly . Just keep them in a natural shape . \",\"Excuse me , I'm looking for the Holiday Inn . Do you know where it is ? \",\" Sure . It's down this street on the left . \",\" Is it far from here ? \",\" No , it's not far . \",\" How far is it ? \",\" About a mile and a half . \",\" How long does it take to get there ? \",\" 5 minutes or so . \",\" Is it close to the subway station ? \",\" Yes , it's very close . The subway station is next to the hotel . You can walk there . \",\" Thanks a lot . \",\"Excuse me , driver . Does this bus go to the museum ? \",\" Yes , you get off at the square . \",\" How long is the ride ? \",\" Well , you will get there in about half an hour if the traffic isn't too heavy . \",\" Thank you.How much is the fare ? \",\" Drop 50 cents in the box , please . \",\" Would you please let me know when we get to the stop ? I am a stranger here . \",\" Sure . I will . \",\"Excuse me , but can you tell me the way to the Today Mall ? \",\" Yes , go down the fifth street . You won't miss it . \",\" How long will it take me to get there ? \",\" It's only about 10 minutes ' walk . \",\" Thank you very much . \",\"Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months , what are your general impression of it ? \",\" I think , maybe , it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , I am no more than a beginner . But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life . \",\" You mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? To some extent your idea holds water . Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . Now we are apt to treat it as an art . \",\" An art ! You have a good point there . So it is called martial arts in English . The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . They even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating . \",\" Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . Do you know Jin Yong ? \",\" I know he is a martial arts fiction writer . But I've read none of his novels . \",\" All of his works have been translated into English . I recommend you to read one or two works of his . You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture . When you go through the pages , you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone , but cover all walks of life . \",\" I see . They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements . \",\" Yes , take philosophy , for instance . What makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? It's not enough only to be formidable . It also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life . \",\" So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ? \",\" Indeed , you're exactly right ! \",\"Julia , look at me ! I'm gaining weight . How could I lose weight ? Do you have any good ideas ? \",\" Since summer is coming , I think swimming is a good way for you to do . \",\" Are you sure ? \",\" Of course ! Swimming can help you stay in shape by targeting all parts of your body . \",\" Really ? Does swimming have other advantages ? \",\" It could also help you increase vital capacity . \",\" That ' s great . Okay , from now on I would swim three times a week . I hope I can get rid of the weight . \",\" You will make it if you persist in it . \",\"Look , I've got a problem here . Will you help me ? \",\" I'm not sure if I can , but I'll try . \",\"How may I help you , miss ? \",\" I want to change my hairstyle . What would you suggest ? \",\" Would you like to have a perm ? \",\" Do you think it will suit me ? \",\" Oh , absolutely . \",\" Ok , I'll have it for a change . \",\"Would you do me a favor ? \",\" I'd be glad to . What is it ? \",\"Hello . My name ' s Linda Brown . What can I do for you today ? \",\" Hi . I ' m Tom Peterson . I ' m looking for a one-bedroom apartment . \",\" Certainly . First , I would like to ask you some questions to identify your needs before I show you what we have . \",\" That ' s fine . \",\" What price range are you interested in ? \",\" Well , between $ 350-400 a month . \",\" Okay . Do you have a special location in mind ? \",\" I ' d like to live somewhere near the university , or at least on a bus line . \",\" When would you like to move in ? \",\" As soon as possible . \",\" How about the end of this month ? \",\" Fine . \",\" Are there any special features that you would like to have , such as , a dishwasher , a balcony , a swimming pool , central air conditionining , etc . ? \",\" I would like to have a dishwasher and central air conditioning . \",\" Okay . Here are the photos of the apartments that fit your preferences . \",\" Thank you . This one looks nice . Is it near the university ? \",\" Yes . It ' s only 5 minutes walk from the campus . \",\" That ' s good . I ' d like to see it . \",\"Excuse me . I'm afraid I got lost . Where am I on this map ? \",\" We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city . \",\" Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ? \",\" Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right . \",\"Okay , I ' ll take it . By the way , do you have delivery service ? \",\" You don ' t need to carry the furniture home because we have delivery service . \",\" Do you charge for delivery ? \",\" Wo will deliver the goods to you for free . \",\" Very good . Could you deliver it to this address ? \",\" Sure . Please write down your name and your phone number . \",\" OK . Can you tell me the delivery time ? \",\" No later than tomorrow . \",\" Thanks . \",\"Hi , I'd like to have a beer . \",\" Hi , good evening . Which kind of beer would you like ? \",\" I'd like to try a local beer . What would you suggest ? \",\" How about Yanking Beer ? It's very popular here . \",\" Sounds good . I'll take that . \",\"Good evening , sir . \",\" Good evening . I'll have a Scotch . \",\" Yes , sir . Straight or on the rocks ? \",\" On the rocks , please . \",\"Hello , ma'am . Can I help you ? \",\" Yes , please . I'd like a gin and tonic . \",\" Sure , ma'am . Here you are . \",\" Thank you . How much is it ? \",\" 25 yuan . \",\" Here's 30 . Keep the change . \",\" Thank you very much , ma'am , but we don't take tips in China . \",\"Excuse me . I wonder if you could help me . I'm looking for the Oriental Pearl Theater . \",\" Boy , you are lost . It's across town . \",\" Oh ! What bad luck ! How can I get to the Theater ? \",\" You can take a No . 12 bus here and then transfer to a No . 23 bus to get there . \",\"What do you think about all the different diets people go on ? \",\" I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! \",\" But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? \",\" They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . \",\" So you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? \",\" Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . \",\" How about drinking soda ? \",\" Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try some diet coke . \",\" That's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ? \",\" My mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . \",\" How do you know so much about food and dieting ? \",\" You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now ! \",\"I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said . \",\" I said , \\\" Do you want me to help you ? \\\" \",\" If you're sure you're not in a hurry , I can use a little help . \",\" OK . Would you like me to get you a cab ? \",\"Hi , Mark . \",\" Hi , Bill . I ' d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday . \",\" All right . \",\" So , what do we do now ? \",\" This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords . \",\" Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ' ll deposit one month ' s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ' s rent in advance . I understand that I ' ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs . \",\" Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out . \",\" Can I pay you by check ? \",\" Sure . A check will be fine . \",\" Is there a laundry room in the basement ? \",\" Yes . \",\" Can I sign the lease right now ? \",\"Yes , ma'am , how could I help you ? \",\" I am wondering if you do facial care ? \",\" Yes , we do . \",\" How much would it be ? \",\" From 200 to 800 . \",\" I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ? \",\" No problem . \",\"I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said . \",\" I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? ' \",\" I'm trying to find a post office . \",\" Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there . \",\" Should I take the bus ? \",\" No . It'll only take about five minutes to walk . \",\" Thank you very much . \",\" Anytime . \",\"Hello , Steven . Annie said that you and Julia have had a quarrel , haven ' t you ? \",\" That ' s true . We had an argument yesterday . She blamed me for not preparing the supper that day , but it was her turn to cook the dinner . \",\" That's the reason why you fought ? \",\" Yes . \",\" You two are always quarrelling over little things . \",\" That wasn ' t my fault , but she said ' you're a disgrace ' to me . I'm about to explode ! \",\" Are you still mad at her now ? \",\" To be honest , I ' m not , and I regret a little what I have done . \",\" Will you apologize to her ? \",\" No way . It ' s her who should apologize . \",\"Julia , I apologize to you for what I have done . Please forgive me . \",\" I've already forgiven you . Actually , I also owe you an apology . I was so rude to you that day . \",\" It does ' t matter . I know that people are easy to get mad when they're tired . \",\" Thanks for your understanding . \",\" You're welcome . Happy couples need mutual understanding . \",\"Hi , I ' m the superintendent of this building . What can I do for you ? \",\" Hi , I ' m Paul . Could you show me the apartment on the first floor ? \",\" Sure . Let ' s go . \",\" I like this one . How much is the rent ? \",\" $ 850 a month . \",\" Does the rent include utilities ? \",\" No . Utilities are extra . \",\" Where ' s the laundry room ? \",\" It ' s on the other side of this floor . \",\" What ' s your rule about pets ? \",\" We allow one or two pets but you have to pay a $ 300 deposit . \",\" How come ? \",\" If your pet ruins the apartment walls or carpet we ' ll keep your pet deposit . If not , we ' ll return your deposit when you move out . But be careful , we don ' t allow pet snakes in the apartment . \",\" who takes care of bug control ? \",\" We do . We will spray the apartments before you move in . \",\" Thank you very much for taking your time . I ' m still deciding . I will call you tomorrow . \",\"Let me get the keys and we ' ll go to look at it . \",\" Okay . \",\" It ' s the one you like . \",\" Wow ! It ' s really good for me , especially the living room . It is big enough to put all my stuff there . It ' s a deal ! I ' ll rent this one . \",\" Okay . Now we need you to fill a form with your personal information . We need information like social insurance number ( Social security number in the US ) , your address , phone number , etc . We also need a security deposit of $ 200 . And you have to pay two months ' rent in advance for renting the first time . If there ' s nothing damaged , we ' ll give you back one month ' s rent when you move out . You ' ll be responsible for all the utilities . Do you want to sign a lease today ? \",\" Sure ! \",\" Oh , one more thing I forgot . You must let us know two months in advance if you want to stop renting within the contract . Otherwise , you can ' t get your deposit back . \",\" Okay . Thank you for your reminder . \",\" You ' re welcome . Be sure to get the keys one day before you move in . \",\" Thank you again . \",\"Hello , Jenny . What's the matter ? \",\" John , I'm hard up at the moment . Could you lend me five hundred yuan ? I'll return it to you early next month . \",\" No problem , Jenny . Are you sure five hundred is enough ? \",\" Yes . Thank you so much . \",\"Yes , sir ? \",\" I hate to complain , but this soup is too salty . \",\" I'm very sorry , sir . I'll ask the manager to take care of this . \",\"Hello , Steven . Can you do me a favor ? \",\" Sure .

How about you ? \",\" I was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . What do you think ? \",\" I'm absolutely useless at cooking ! \",\" I could teach you how to cook something healthy . Frozen pizza are so bad for you ! \",\" I know they aren't good for you , but they are cheap , convenient , and fairly tasty . \",\" I recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . Maybe we could try that ? \",\" Yeah , why not . Do you have all the ingredients ? \",\" I bought all the ingredients this morning , so let's start ! \",\" What do we do first ? \",\" first , you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces . \",\" Ok . Should I heat the wok ? \",\" Yes . Once it gets hot , put a little oil in it , add the vegetables and stir-fry them for a few minutes . \",\" What about the chicken ? \",\" That needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stir-fried on its own until its cooked through . \",\" How about the rice ? \",\" I'll prepare that . Do you prefer white rice or brown rice ? \",\" White rice , please . None of that healthy brown stuff for me ! \",\"Hi Michael . \",\" Hi Amy . What's up ? \",\" I'm looking for the airport . Can you tell me how to get there ? \",\" No , sorry . I don't know . \",\" I think I can take the subway to the airport . Do you know where the subway is ? \",\" Sure , it's over there . \",\" Where ? I don't see it . \",\" Across the street . \",\" Oh , I see it now . Thanks . \",\" No problem . \",\" Do you know if there's a restroom around here ? \",\" Yes , there's one here . It's in the store . \",\" Thank you . \",\" Bye . \",\"Chris , where are you going ? \",\" I'm going to the store . \",\" Really ?

Let's drive . \",\"Excuse me , but could you give me some change ? \",\" Let me see . Are dimes and quarters OK ? \",\" I want to make a long distance phone call . \",\" Then you'll need small change . \",\"Excuse me , could you give me change for a dollar ? \",\" I'll see what I have .

I can't wait to watch the beautiful sunset . \",\"Are you ready for your first driving lesson ? \",\" Yes . Which one is the brake again ? \",\" The pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas . \",\" I ' m glad this car is an automatic .

The first thing you should do is put your seat belt on . \",\" You should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver ' s seat ! \",\" Very funny . Next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . Can you see out of them ? \",\" I can ' t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . Could you move it forward a bit , please ? \",\" How ' s that ? \",\" That ' s better . Now what ? \",\" Check your petrol situation . \",\" The tank is almost empty .

I thought I'd come back to buy a few more souvenirs . \",\" What did you have in mind ? \",\" Well , first , I'd like to buy a few postcards . My sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . I want to do that , too . \",\" We have plenty of postcards to choose from here . The same designs can be found on these posters . \",\" Posters are difficult to travel with . I think I'll just buy the postcards .

He likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room . \",\" I hate that , either . Did you tell him your feelings ? \",\" Yes . But he doesn't care . I really wouldn't want to move , but I simply can ' t stand him . \",\" It's a problem . You'd better move . \",\"So , how should we get to the theatre ? \",\" Let's take the bus . \",\" I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . \",\" It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . \",\" It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . \",\" We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . \",\" Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . \",\" If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? \",\" We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . \",\" I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours .

My weight has gone up again . \",\" I'm not surprised . You eat too much . \",\" And I suppose sitting at a desk all day at the office doesn't help . \",\" Yes , I think so . \",\" I do wish I could lose weight \",\" Well , why don't you go on a diet ? \",\" I've tried diets before but they've never worked . \",\" Perhaps you should exercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class ? \",\" Yes , maybe I should . \",\"Excuse me . Do you know how to get to the mall ? \",\" Sure , I used to work there .

Can I open a postal savings account in your office ? \",\" Of course . What kind of postal savings account do you want to open ? \",\" Hum .. Can you recommend me one with high interest ? \",\" OK . We offer a few different kinds of postal saving services . They have different interest rates . \",\" I want the one with the highest interest rate . \",\" That would be our Savers Plus account .

May I help you ? \",\" Yes , thank you . I want to get a handbag . \",\" Do you want it for yourself or for your girlfriend ? \",\" No , I have no girlfriend . \",\" Please excuse me for what I said just now . What do you think of this one ? \",\" I am afraid it is too big . \",\" Sorry . It is the smallest size we have . \",\" Too bad . But , is there any other leather store nearby ? \",\" Oh , yes . There is a big one at the right corner of the street . Perhaps you will get one there . \",\" I hope so . Thanks . \",\"Hello , ma ' am .

It's the fashion now . \",\" I don't like it . Actually I am looking slacks . \",\" Then , how about this ? \",\" It seems all right . Do you have pantaloons ? \",\"Did you smell something ? It smells so great . \",\" It must come from the bakery on the corner.They are baking cookies . Their cookies are very popular in town . \",\" How come I never knew that ? Do they have a new baker or something ? \",\" I think so . The bakery invited a famous baker from the USA . He is good at making cookies . \",\" Let's go and get some cookies . I am hungry now . \",\" Look at the swiss roll over there , they look delicious , too , I am thinking about buying one . \",\" You can taste some before you buy it . They have food tasting at the counter . \",\" I am starting loving this bakery now . \",\" It's one of my favorite bakeries . \",\" You should have told me earlier . I am a cookie lover . \",\"Can your dog do any tricks ? \",\" Sure he can . He can shake hands , roll over , and even play dead . \",\" I wish I had a dog . My cat can't do any tricks . \",\" Yeah , but sometimes Bingo wants to play with me , but I don't have time . \",\" So who takes care of him then ? \",\" My little brother likes to play with him . He even gives him a bath every week . \",\" I can't do that with my cat . She hates water . \",\" You know , you're right . Maybe you should get a dog . \",\"Your dog is really cute . What's his name ? \",\" His name is Bingo . \",\" What kind of dog is he ? \",\" We're not sure because the neighbour gave him to us after they moved away . \",\" Well , he sure likes to run around a lot . Is he well behaved ? \",\" Oh yes , he is . When he was a puppy , he liked to chew my father's shoes , but he's okay now . \",\" That sounds like my cat . She likes to scratch the couch with her claws . \",\" I didn't know you had a cat . When did you get her ? \",\" About a year ago actually . You've probably never seen her though . \",\" Really ? Why is that ? \",\" She's not a house-cat . She stays outside most of the time . \",\" Bingo could never do that . He stays in the house except when we take him to the park . \",\"Excuse me . Check please . \",\" OK , how was everything ? \",\" Very nice . Thank you . \",\" Would you like this to-go ? \",\" Yes , can you put it in a plastic bag ? \",\" Sure , no problem . Here you are .

Can you please turn off the lights and shut the door ? \",\" Sure . \",\"I want to buy a shirt . \",\" What color do you like ? \",\" A white one , please . \",\" Maybe you could have a look at this one . \",\" What's the size ? \",\" Large . \",\" I think a medium one will do . \",\"If you like you can try it on.The fitting room is in the corner . \",\" OK . What do you think of it ? \",\" I think it fits you . It flatters your figure . \",\" I think so . But can I try another one ? I don't like the color . \",\"May I try this on ? \",\" Sure . The color is perfect for you . \",\" What material is it made of ? \",\" It's made of cotton . \",\" That's good.Cotton is soft and flexible . \",\"Is there anything I can do for you ? \",\" Yes , I am looking for a skirt .

You have a good taste . It's excellent for its handiness , elegance and beauty . \",\" Can I try it on ? \",\"Ange , can your dog do any tricks yet ? \",\" Oh , yeah ! He can sit down , roll over , and even play dead . \",\" Really ? Does he chase balls ? \",\" Yup.Hey , do you want to see a picture ? See , he's eating lunch . \",\" This can't be the same dog . He's so clean , he shines . \",\" See , he's wagging his tail . \",\" He's really cute . His bowl even has his name on it . \",\"What's the latest fashion of evening gown ? \",\" The one on the manikin is in fashion now . \",\" I would like to try on one in violet . \",\" OK , here you are . You look really attractive in that gown . \",\" Thank you . Do you have some other colors ? \",\"May I be of any help ? \",\" Yes . Show me the sweaters , please . \",\" What style ? \",\" Well , could you bring me all the styles of pullovers ? I am not quite sure which one I will buy . \",\" Ok . Here are the ones , turtleneck pullover , crewneck pullover , V-neck pullover and cowl-neck pullover . \",\"Where do you want to go ? \",\" I am going to the Capital Hotel . \",\" Get in . I will take you there . \",\" About how much it will cost ? \",\" $ 50 . \",\" On the meter ? \",\" Ye , of course . \",\" OK.let ' s go . \",\"Is there anything I can do for you ? \",\" I want a chemise . \",\" You have really good taste . It's the best seller right now . \",\" Could I try it on ? \",\" Sure . \",\" Well . It's not my taste . Would you please bring me a short sleeve ? \",\"The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round , okay ? \",\" Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time . We should be able to down it before they close . \",\" That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ? \",\" It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ? \",\" Yeah . I think I can find it . \",\" You're back already . That sure was quick . \",\" That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me . \",\" Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer.Anyway.He said it was too close to closing time . \",\" Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway . \",\" Okay , let's go ! \",\"Now , madam , here is the Hotel . \",\" What's the fare ? \",\" $ 15 . \",\" The fare is different from the meter . \",\" Well , madam , the meter was not on at all . You didn't tell me . \",\" But I thought it was . Anyway . I am in a hurry . Here is the money . \",\"Excuse me , driver . Let me off here , please . \",\" Well , it's not the supermarket you want . \",\" I have just changed my plan . \",\" OK . \",\" Here is the fare and keep the change please . \",\"Excuse me , Ma ' am . I would like to mail this package door to door via airmail to London . It is a very important package and has to be sent within 3 days . \",\" No problem .

D . number and ways to contact you here . \",\" Do I need to include my zip code in the address ? \",\" You had better include that because it is easier for the mailmen to find the correct mailing address . \",\" Thank you very much . Here is 500 dollars . \",\" Here is your receipt . Contact us if your friend still doesn't receive the package after 5 work days . \",\"Thank God , it's Friday ! Time for a drink ! Let's hit the bars ! \",\" OK . I don't mind going bar hopping with an expert like you . \",\" Should we start with beer or wine or go straight to the hard liquor ? \",\" I think I'll have a glass of wine . Let's see ... they have red wine , white wine and port . They even have sangria ! It's the happy hour special . \",\" Port's too sweet . It's a dessert wine . A dry red French wine would be nice with meat . A glass of chilled white German wine would be good with fish . But , we're not eating and it's hot out , so I think I'll have a tall glass of sangria with ice . \",\" Good choice ! But , what's your favorite kind of hard liquor ? \",\" I like to stick to the clean stuff , like vodka , gin , white rum and other clear spirits . \",\"Excuse me , can I have a look at the green coat ? \",\" Certainly . Here you are . It's a new arrival . \",\" Yes , I like the style.Can I try this on ? \",\" Sure . The fitting room is in the corner . \",\"It's a beautiful day ! Let's play on those rides in the park . \",\" Sounds like a good idea . I love to play on the jungle gym . \",\" Me too . I love to play on the swing as well . Swing is my favorite . \",\" That's great . Then we won't fight over taking the same ride . \",\" Look at the flowers over there . What are they ? \",\" They are morning glories . They are cute , aren't they ? \",\" They are . We can find many different kinds of flowers and insects in the park . \",\" I think so . Last time I saw dandelions and ladybugs near the pond . \",\" If you come to the park in the morning , you can find squirrels running on the lawn . \",\" It's really healthy to do some exercise there . The air is fresher and it's romantic to watch the sunset with your lover . \",\" Well , off we go . I am sure we can have a great time . \",\"Do you have sport shirts for ladies ? \",\" There are different types . Which one do you like best ? \",\" I think the red one fits me well . Can I try it on ? \",\" Surely , of course . \",\" Where is the fitting room ? \",\" It's there , near the mirror . \",\"The dress looks beautiful . Can I touch it ? \",\" I am sorry , miss , it's not allowed unless you want to buy it . \",\" I see . What about the dress over there ? I would like to try it on . \",\" OK , here you are . The fitting room is behind the curtain . \",\"Are you looking for shoes ? \",\" Yes , could you give me some ideas ? \",\" What about this brown one ? \",\" Fine , it's the thing for me . I will take it . \",\"Can I try this dress on ? \",\" Sure.the fitting room is right behind you . \",\" Well , I like the styte , but I don't think the color fits me . Could you bring me a green one ? \",\" Sure , wait a moment . \",\"Could you give me some advice ? \",\" The dress is made on your measurement . \",\" It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I will like it better . \",\" OK , maybe you can try this one on . It's yellow . \",\"Oh , my god . I am so heavy now . I gain 10 kilos . \",\" I am going to the gym . Do you want to come with me ? \",\" I think I should go . I really need to lose some weight . \",\" Then , I'll wait for you at the car park in 20 minutes . \",\" 0K.See you then . \",\" Do you have your member card with you ? \",\" Nope , I do not have a membership yet . \",\" Well I have a guest ticket . You can use it . \",\" That is so nice of you . If I like the service and the training equipment , I think I well join the club . \",\"I can't find my glasses and I can't see anything . Can you help me find a few things ? \",\" No problem . What are you looking for ? \",\" My laptop , do you see it ? \",\" Yes , your laptop is on the chair . \",\" Where's my book ? \",\" Which one ? \",\" The dictionary . \",\" It's under the table . \",\" Where's my pencil ? \",\" There's a pencil in front of the lamp . \",\" That's not a pencil . That's a pen . \",\" Oh , sorry . There is a pencil behind the cup . \",\" How about my backpack ? Do you know where that is ? \",\" It's in between the wall and the bed . \",\" Where are my shoes ? \",\" They're on the left side of the TV . \",\" I don't see them . \",\" Sorry , I made a mistake . They're on the right side of the TV . \",\" Thanks . \",\" Oh , and here are your glasses . They were next to your cell phone . \",\"This one is too small . Please bring me a bigger one . \",\" OK . \",\" What's the brand ? \",\" Leopard . It's famous brand of good quality . \",\" This one suits better . I will take it . \",\"I want to buy a black suit . \",\" Certainty.Do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit ? \",\" I prefer single breasted suit . \",\" What about this one ? It's a very nice 3 - piece suit . \",\" That looks great . Do you have ties here ? \",\"Could I be of any help to you ? \",\" I want to buy a skirt , but I have no idea which one to buy . \",\" Do you like miniskirt ? It's popular among young girls . The pleated skirt also sells well . \",\" I don't like to keep up with joneses . \",\" What about the divided skirt ? \",\" I think this suits me . Can I try it on ? \",\"Do you have the same in different sizes ? The trousers are too long for me . \",\" Let me see . Yes , here you are . \",\" Will the trousers shrink when washed ? \",\" No , they won't . They are shrink proof . \",\" That's good . I will take it . \",\"Do you get up early every morning ? \",\" About 6 in the morning . I like to walk to the office . \",\" Good habit . How long does it take ? \",\" About 20 minutes . Do you live alone ? \",\" No , my little sister lives with me . \",\" How old is she ? \",\" About 12 . She is a good girl . \",\" I think so . \",\"OK , Lucy.It ' s your turn.Are you ready ? \",\" I really would rather just listen.Isn ' t there anyone else who wants to sing ? \",\" Come on ! In the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song ! \",\" I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night . \",\" Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis ' song for him . \",\" I'll put the song at the front of the list . \",\"Who wants to go first ? Lily ? \",\" Oh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ? \",\" OK.Put on something by the Backstreet Boys ! \",\" How about As Long as You Love Me ? You can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee Brooke ! \",\" I'd better not . Brooke hates the Backstreet Boys ! \",\"I've been learning to play go recently . It's an amazing game ! \",\" Weigh ? It must be a greatest Chinese invention . I've tried hard to learn it . Its rules can't be any simpler , but I've never won a game of Go . Well , it's all Greek to me ! \",\" At least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you ? I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go . \",\" I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ? \",\" Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness . \",\" I know it is quite different from Western chess . \",\" Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill . \",\" But isn't it the same with wiki ? \",\" Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive . \",\"May I take a look at the shoes over there ? \",\" Certainly . What's your size ? \",\" Size 24 . Are they synthetic or leather ? \",\" They are all leather . How do they feel ? \",\" It's comfortable . I will take it . \",\"Try it on in front of the mirror . \",\" Well , I think the color is a little too bright . \",\" We have darker ones . Do you like the style ? \",\" Yes . What's this made of and how to wash it ? \",\" lt's made of silk and you had better wash it by hand in cold water . \",\"Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mic ! \",\" If I hear Love Me Tender one more time , I think I'll go crazy ! \",\" He sounds like a sick cow ! \",\" Can we adjust the pitch a little ?
