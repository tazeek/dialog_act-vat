          " Getting worse . Now he ' s eating me out of house and home . I ' Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . ",
          " Leo , I really think you ' re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ' s time to lay down the law . ",

          " But I don't speak English at all . ",
          " That's OK . The program is especially for the beginners like us . ",

          " Yes . Let me get you a pair . ",
          "What a mess ! ",
          " Sorry . I'll clean it up . ",
          "I wonder if we can change to Channel 5 . ",
          " Why ? ",
          " I want to know what's on that channel . ",
          " Oh , good . ",
          " There is a football match . ",
          " I prefer TV play to football . ",
          " OK . Could you turn it down ? ",
          " What are you going to do ? ",
          " I'm going to listen to the radio . ",
          " Maybe we can enjoy the TV play together . It's interesting . ",
          "Excuse me , can you show me the cloisonn bracelet in the counter ? ",
          " Sure . Let me get it for you . ",
          " Can you also show me this one ? ",

          " I don't . Is there anything worth watching on the other channel ? ",
          " I think it's a basketball match on channel 5 . ",
          " Do you mind if we switch over ? ",
          " Well , I'd rather see a movie . ",
          " What's the movie ? ",
          " ' Star war ' . ",
          " It must be interesting . ",
          " Yes , you're right . ",

          " Is there anything interesting ? ",
          " Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education . ",
          " I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ? ",
          " Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs . ",
          " That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ? ",
          " Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals . ",
          " I got it . Do you pay for the programs ? ",
          " Yes , 50 Yuan per month . ",
          " It is a little bit expensive , but it's worth it . ",
          " Yeah . You know driving is boring . TV can get me out of the fatigue of driving . ",
          " It can also entertain your passengers like me . ",
          " That's the point . ",
          "Jenny , you're too lazy . You should do some exercise . See , you're getting fat . ",
          " Dad , it's raining outside . ",
          " That is your excuse . ",
          " All right , all right , I will go swimming with Peter this afternoon . ",
          " Not just today . Go exercise everyday ! ",
          "Peter , enough with your computer games . Go do your homework now . ",
          " Can't I play more ? ",
          " No ! Stop playing computer games ! ",
          " Mom , I'll be finished soon . ",
          " Peter , if you don't turn off your computer , then I won't allow you to play it again starting next week . ",
          "Hi , who has the remote control ? ",
          " I do . Why , do you want me to change the channel ? ",
          " Yes , please . I can't stand watching the channel any more . ",
          " I think they have pretty good programmes . But I'll change it if you really want . ",
          " Put it on Channel 5 , OK ? ",
          " Oh , I hate Channel 5 . I'd rather just listen to the radio . ",
          " Don't make such a fuss . I'm sure you will like today's programme . ",
          " What's on today ? ",
          " A basketball match between Chinese team and American team . ",
          " Really ? I'm interested in it . ",
          " It might begin now . ",
          "Peter , where are you going ? ",
          " I'm going to do some shopping . ",
          " Won't you watch TV ? ",
          " What's on TV tonight ? Is there a football match ? ",
          " The TV station will air the World Cup football match alive at 8: 30 . ",
          " Really ? Who will play ? ",
          " The Brazilian team versus the American team . Don't miss it . ",
          " That's cool . I'll watch it . ",
          " Who do you think will win ? ",
          " There is no doubt that the Brazilian team will win . ",
          " I think so . ",
          "May I have a cookie ? ",
          " Help yourself . ",
          "By the way , where's Jim ? ",
          " He is out . ",
          "Watch out ! ",
          " Wow ! That car almost hit me . ",
          "Eat some more . ",
          " No , thanks . I'm on a diet . ",
          "Hurry up , will you ? ",
          " What's the rush ? ",
          "Kata ! You've got a beautiful singing voice . You hit the high notes perfectly . ",
          " Thank you for your compliment . But you are exaggerating . I think you are destined to be a singer . You have the best voice ! ",
          " Thank you . Maybe we can sing a song together . Would you like to sing with me ? ",
          " Yes , I'd like to . It's my honor . Let's pick a song . ",
          " How about this one ? ",
          " Sorry , I can't sing the song . ",
          " Er ... How about this one ? ",
          " OK . But I'm not familiar . I don't know the beginning part . ",
          " Never mind . You can follow me . I'll sing the first part . ",
          " OK . ",
          "Peter , go and tidy up your toys now . ",
          " Wait a moment , mom . ",
          " I'm mad ! I said now ! Turn off the TV , and do it now . ",
          " Mom , just ten more minutes . The show is going to be over soon . ",
          " Peter , if you don't do it soon , I will throw your toys in the trash can . ",
          "Sorry , I'm late . ",
          " It doesn't matter . ",
          "Excuse me , I've been waiting here for 10 minutes . Do you know how often does No . 636 run ? ",
          " It runs every 15 minutes . You must have missed it . ",
          " It seems you got here at good time . Do you have a bus schedule ? ",
          " Yes , I do . You can buy a bus schedule in a news stand . ",
          " I see , thank you . By the way , is this the right bus for the Museum ? ",
          " Yes , it is . ",
          " Do I have to change ? ",
          " No . The Museum is the terminal of this bus . ",
          " Thanks a lot . ",
          " You are welcome . ",
          "Mom , can I have more allowance ? ",
          " What for ? ",
          " I want to buy more books . ",
          " Oh , yeah ? Are you joking ? ",
          " Of course not ! I'm telling the truth . ",
          " Honey , it's good if you spend money to buy more books . But $ 100 dollars a week is enough for you already . ",
          "Two burgers , please . ",
          " For here or to go ? ",
          "Dad , may I have a room of my own ? ",
          " Oh , honey , I'm so sorry , we don't have enough space for you to have your own room . ",
          " Dad , but I don't want to share a room with Peter . He snores every night . ",
          " Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ? ",
          " Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it . ",
          "Open the book and turn to page 10 . ",
          " It is difficult . ",
          " No , honey , it's easy if you know the way . ",
          " Do I have to memorize it ? ",
          " No , honey , try to make notes in your notebook . ",
          "Peter , wash your hands first , and then have some dessert . ",
          " Mom , can I have some ice cream ? ",
          " Not today , Honey . Don't eat too much ice cream . ",
          " Mom , can I have one more piece of cake ? ",
          " Ok . The last piece is for your dessert . We're having dinner soon . ",
          "Dad , can you help me ? ",
          " Oh , honey , you made a mistake . ",
          " I don't know how to do it . ",
          " OK . Let's do it together . ",
          " 16 divided by 2 . What's the answer ? ",
          " 16 divided by 2 equals 8 . ",
          " You got it . Good job . ",
          "How was your test ? ",
          " It was bad . ",
          " Oh , honey , you should study harder . ",
          " But I already tried my best . ",
          " Don't worry . You'll do better next time . ",
          "Is Bob home ? ",
          " Sorry . You've got the wrong number . ",
          "Dad , how do you say this word ? ",
          " Sword , say it ' sword ' . ",
          " What does this word mean ? ",
          " Look it up in the dictionary . ",
          " Dad , can you just tell me what it means ? I'm too lazy . ",
          " No , honey , go and read it . You'll learn . ",
          "Jenny , what's your favorite color ? ",
          " I like red . ",
          " Now , we're going to draw an apple in your sketch book . What do we use ? ",
          " Dad , I want to draw with crayons , can I ? ",
          " Why not ? Let's draw the outline of an apple with your pencil first . ",
          "Mom , my nose is bleeding . ",
          " What happened , Peter ? Did you have a fight ? ",
          " No , mom . I didn't . ",
          " Did somebody hit you ? Or did you just fall ? ",
          " Mom ! I was just picking my nose , and now it's bleeding . ",
          "Something's wrong with my air conditioning . ",
          " Leave it to me . I'll fix it . ",
          "Mom , I don't feel well . ",
          " Are you sick ? ",
          " I feel dizzy . ",
          " Let me take your temperature . ",
          " Mom , I don't want to go to see a doctor . ",
          " Oh , honey , I think you've caught a cold , you should get a shot . ",
          "What do you want to be ? ",
          " Dad , I haven't thought about it . I'm still young . ",
          " Oh , honey , but you must know what your hobby is , right ? ",
          " I like playing the piano . ",
          " Yes , you play the piano well . You could be a good pianist . That's good . ",
          "Where are you off to ? ",
          " The movies . ",
          "May I have the menu , please ? ",
          " Sure . Here you go . ",
          "Peter , do you want to learn to play the piano ? ",
          " No , mom . Piano is for girls . ",
          " Well , there are many boys that can play the piano very well , like Jay Chou . ",
          " No way , mom . I don't like piano . ",
          " OK . But you have to promise me that you will study hard in your English class . ",
          " All right , all right . I understand . ",
          "Jenny , Can you come and help me ? ",
          " Mom , what should I do ? ",
          " It's dusty everywhere in the house . Can you help me do the housecleaning ? ",
          " OK . I will call Peter to clean it together . ",
          " That's my good girl . The clothes need washing . I'll do the laundry . ",
          "Mom , what are we going to make tonight ? ",
          " Curry and rice . What do you think ? ",
          " That sounds nice . I can peel the potatoes first . ",
          " Really ! Oh , honey , you are so sweet . I'll chop up this carrot . ",
          " Mom , the water is boiling ! ",
          " Honey , just turn down the stove . ",
          "Can you make out what he's saying ? ",
          " No , it's too loud in here . ",
          "It's your turn now , Helen . ",
          " OK . I'm coming . ",
          " This is your song . I picked it for you . ",
          " Thank you . You are so considerate . ",
          " Push the red button on the mike to turn it on . ",
          " OK . This key is too high for me . ",
          " I think it's a piece of cake for you . ",
          " OK . Let me have a try ... ",
          " Well done ! I hope I can sing as well as you one day . ",
          " Thank you . I'm sure you will . ",
          " I hope so . Thank you for saying so . ",
          "Dinner's ready ! Come and get it ! ",
          " Coming ! ",
          "Have you got a minute ? ",
          " Sure . What's up ? ",
          "Who is the next one ? ",
          " It's Peter's turn . ",
          " Give the mike to him . ",
          " OK . ",
          " Be quiet . He is singing . ",
          " I thought he only liked to listen ! ",
          " So did I . ",
          " He has a really good voice ! ",
          " Yes , he sings wonderfully . ",
          "Can you pass me the lighter ? ",
          " Here . Catch ! ",
          "Have you ever sung with a karaoke ? ",
          " Yes , I do it quite often . ",
          " Karaoke has become a major entertainment . I wonder why . ",
          " Simple , it's fun . ",
          " How much fun is there in singing in front of other people , especially if you don't sing well ? ",
          " Ah , that's the biggest fun of all . You see , even though you're not a good singer , people will listen to you . ",
          " I wouldn't do that . ",
          " But I like the feeling . ",
          "What kind of music do you like ? ",

          " Go ahead . ",
          "Where's the toilet ? ",
          " Over there . ",

We have black , white and transparent panty-hose here . \",\"Do you have any fresh baked donuts for sale yet ? \",\" They will be ready in about half an hour . Do you need anything else ? \",\" Yes , I'd like five croissants , too . \",\" It's going to be 3 dollars 40 cents . \",\"Taxi ! \",\" Yes , sir . Where to ? \",\" Wangfujing , please ! \",\" All right . \",\" Oh , I like the music on your radio . It's nice . \",\" Thank you ! I always tune to this program when driving . So what's your favorite program ? \",\" I like Winner's English very mush . You know the Beijing Olympic Games is right around the corner . We should learn English Well . It's on FM 96.6 , China Business Radio . You can get it on your radio too . \",\" But I don't speak English at all . \",\" That's OK . The program is especially for the beginners like us . \",\" Really ? When is it on ? \",\" It begins at 6:40 every morning , and it goes for 20 minutes . \",\" Thank you so much . I'll try and catch that . \",\" The radio has brought us lots of convenience . \",\" Yes , I can also learn about the traffic condition through it . \",\" With the development of the society and technology , radio is nearly everywhere . \",\" So we should take the advantage of it . \",\"Do you have these shoes in a size 7 ? \",\" Yes . Let me get you a pair . \",\"What a mess ! \",\" Sorry . I'll clean it up . \",\"I wonder if we can change to Channel 5 . \",\" Why ? \",\" I want to know what's on that channel . \",\" Oh , good . \",\" There is a football match . \",\" I prefer TV play to football . \",\" OK . Could you turn it down ? \",\" What are you going to do ? \",\" I'm going to listen to the radio . \",\" Maybe we can enjoy the TV play together . It's interesting . \",\"Excuse me , can you show me the cloisonn bracelet in the counter ? \",\" Sure . Let me get it for you . \",\" Can you also show me this one ? \",\" No problem . This one is made of pure gold . \",\" I think the cloisonn bracelet is more beautiful . \",\" You ' re right .

Is there anything worth watching on the other channel ? \",\" I think it's a basketball match on channel 5 . \",\" Do you mind if we switch over ? \",\" Well , I'd rather see a movie . \",\" What's the movie ? \",\" ' Star war ' . \",\" It must be interesting . \",\" Yes , you're right . \",\"Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ? \",\" It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . \",\" Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ? \",\" News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on . \",\" Is there anything interesting ? \",\" Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education . \",\" I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ? \",\" Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs . \",\" That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ? \",\" Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals . \",\" I got it . Do you pay for the programs ? \",\" Yes , 50 Yuan per month . \",\" It is a little bit expensive , but it's worth it . \",\" Yeah . You know driving is boring . TV can get me out of the fatigue of driving . \",\" It can also entertain your passengers like me . \",\" That's the point . \",\"Jenny , you're too lazy . You should do some exercise . See , you're getting fat . \",\" Dad , it's raining outside . \",\" That is your excuse . \",\" All right , all right , I will go swimming with Peter this afternoon . \",\" Not just today . Go exercise everyday ! \",\"Peter , enough with your computer games . Go do your homework now . \",\" Can't I play more ? \",\" No ! Stop playing computer games ! \",\" Mom , I'll be finished soon . \",\" Peter , if you don't turn off your computer , then I won't allow you to play it again starting next week . \",\"Hi , who has the remote control ? \",\" I do . Why , do you want me to change the channel ? \",\" Yes , please . I can't stand watching the channel any more . \",\" I think they have pretty good programmes . But I'll change it if you really want . \",\" Put it on Channel 5 , OK ? \",\" Oh , I hate Channel 5 . I'd rather just listen to the radio . \",\" Don't make such a fuss . I'm sure you will like today's programme . \",\" What's on today ? \",\" A basketball match between Chinese team and American team . \",\" Really ? I'm interested in it . \",\" It might begin now . \",\"Peter , where are you going ? \",\" I'm going to do some shopping . \",\" Won't you watch TV ? \",\" What's on TV tonight ? Is there a football match ? \",\" The TV station will air the World Cup football match alive at 8: 30 . \",\" Really ? Who will play ? \",\" The Brazilian team versus the American team . Don't miss it . \",\" That's cool . I'll watch it . \",\" Who do you think will win ? \",\" There is no doubt that the Brazilian team will win . \",\" I think so . \",\"May I have a cookie ? \",\" Help yourself . \",\"By the way , where's Jim ? \",\" He is out . \",\"Watch out ! \",\" Wow ! That car almost hit me . \",\"Eat some more . \",\" No , thanks . I'm on a diet . \",\"Hurry up , will you ? \",\" What's the rush ? \",\"Kata ! You've got a beautiful singing voice . You hit the high notes perfectly . \",\" Thank you for your compliment . But you are exaggerating . I think you are destined to be a singer . You have the best voice ! \",\" Thank you . Maybe we can sing a song together . Would you like to sing with me ? \",\" Yes , I'd like to . It's my honor . Let's pick a song . \",\" How about this one ? \",\" Sorry , I can't sing the song . \",\" Er ... How about this one ? \",\" OK . But I'm not familiar . I don't know the beginning part . \",\" Never mind . You can follow me . I'll sing the first part . \",\" OK . \",\"Peter , go and tidy up your toys now . \",\" Wait a moment , mom . \",\" I'm mad ! I said now ! Turn off the TV , and do it now . \",\" Mom , just ten more minutes . The show is going to be over soon . \",\" Peter , if you don't do it soon , I will throw your toys in the trash can . \",\"Sorry , I'm late . \",\" It doesn't matter . \",\"Excuse me , I've been waiting here for 10 minutes . Do you know how often does No . 636 run ? \",\" It runs every 15 minutes . You must have missed it . \",\" It seems you got here at good time . Do you have a bus schedule ? \",\" Yes , I do . You can buy a bus schedule in a news stand . \",\" I see , thank you . By the way , is this the right bus for the Museum ? \",\" Yes , it is . \",\" Do I have to change ? \",\" No . The Museum is the terminal of this bus . \",\" Thanks a lot . \",\" You are welcome . \",\"Mom , can I have more allowance ? \",\" What for ? \",\" I want to buy more books . \",\" Oh , yeah ? Are you joking ? \",\" Of course not ! I'm telling the truth . \",\" Honey , it's good if you spend money to buy more books . But $ 100 dollars a week is enough for you already . \",\"Two burgers , please . \",\" For here or to go ? \",\"Dad , may I have a room of my own ? \",\" Oh , honey , I'm so sorry , we don't have enough space for you to have your own room . \",\" Dad , but I don't want to share a room with Peter . He snores every night . \",\" Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ? \",\" Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it . \",\"Open the book and turn to page 10 . \",\" It is difficult . \",\" No , honey , it's easy if you know the way . \",\" Do I have to memorize it ? \",\" No , honey , try to make notes in your notebook . \",\"Peter , wash your hands first , and then have some dessert . \",\" Mom , can I have some ice cream ? \",\" Not today , Honey . Don't eat too much ice cream . \",\" Mom , can I have one more piece of cake ? \",\" Ok . The last piece is for your dessert . We're having dinner soon . \",\"Dad , can you help me ? \",\" Oh , honey , you made a mistake . \",\" I don't know how to do it . \",\" OK . Let's do it together . \",\" 16 divided by 2 . What's the answer ? \",\" 16 divided by 2 equals 8 . \",\" You got it . Good job . \",\"How was your test ? \",\" It was bad . \",\" Oh , honey , you should study harder . \",\" But I already tried my best . \",\" Don't worry . You'll do better next time . \",\"Is Bob home ? \",\" Sorry . You've got the wrong number . \",\"Dad , how do you say this word ? \",\" Sword , say it ' sword ' . \",\" What does this word mean ? \",\" Look it up in the dictionary . \",\" Dad , can you just tell me what it means ? I'm too lazy . \",\" No , honey , go and read it . You'll learn . \",\"Jenny , what's your favorite color ? \",\" I like red . \",\" Now , we're going to draw an apple in your sketch book . What do we use ? \",\" Dad , I want to draw with crayons , can I ? \",\" Why not ? Let's draw the outline of an apple with your pencil first . \",\"Mom , my nose is bleeding . \",\" What happened , Peter ? Did you have a fight ? \",\" No , mom . I didn't . \",\" Did somebody hit you ? Or did you just fall ? \",\" Mom ! I was just picking my nose , and now it's bleeding . \",\"Something's wrong with my air conditioning . \",\" Leave it to me . I'll fix it . \",\"Mom , I don't feel well . \",\" Are you sick ? \",\" I feel dizzy . \",\" Let me take your temperature . \",\" Mom , I don't want to go to see a doctor . \",\" Oh , honey , I think you've caught a cold , you should get a shot . \",\"What do you want to be ? \",\" Dad , I haven't thought about it . I'm still young . \",\" Oh , honey , but you must know what your hobby is , right ? \",\" I like playing the piano . \",\" Yes , you play the piano well . You could be a good pianist . That's good . \",\"Where are you off to ? \",\" The movies . \",\"May I have the menu , please ? \",\" Sure . Here you go . \",\"Peter , do you want to learn to play the piano ? \",\" No , mom . Piano is for girls . \",\" Well , there are many boys that can play the piano very well , like Jay Chou . \",\" No way , mom . I don't like piano . \",\" OK . But you have to promise me that you will study hard in your English class . \",\" All right , all right . I understand . \",\"Jenny , Can you come and help me ? \",\" Mom , what should I do ? \",\" It's dusty everywhere in the house . Can you help me do the housecleaning ? \",\" OK . I will call Peter to clean it together . \",\" That's my good girl . The clothes need washing . I'll do the laundry . \",\"Mom , what are we going to make tonight ? \",\" Curry and rice . What do you think ? \",\" That sounds nice . I can peel the potatoes first . \",\" Really ! Oh , honey , you are so sweet . I'll chop up this carrot . \",\" Mom , the water is boiling ! \",\" Honey , just turn down the stove . \",\"Can you make out what he's saying ? \",\" No , it's too loud in here . \",\"It's your turn now , Helen . \",\" OK . I'm coming . \",\" This is your song . I picked it for you . \",\" Thank you . You are so considerate . \",\" Push the red button on the mike to turn it on . \",\" OK . This key is too high for me . \",\" I think it's a piece of cake for you . \",\" OK . Let me have a try ... \",\" Well done ! I hope I can sing as well as you one day . \",\" Thank you . I'm sure you will . \",\" I hope so . Thank you for saying so . \",\"Dinner's ready ! Come and get it ! \",\" Coming ! \",\"Have you got a minute ? \",\" Sure . What's up ? \",\"Who is the next one ? \",\" It's Peter's turn . \",\" Give the mike to him . \",\" OK . \",\" Be quiet . He is singing . \",\" I thought he only liked to listen ! \",\" So did I . \",\" He has a really good voice ! \",\" Yes , he sings wonderfully . \",\"Can you pass me the lighter ? \",\" Here . Catch ! \",\"Have you ever sung with a karaoke ? \",\" Yes , I do it quite often . \",\" Karaoke has become a major entertainment . I wonder why . \",\" Simple , it's fun . \",\" How much fun is there in singing in front of other people , especially if you don't sing well ? \",\" Ah , that's the biggest fun of all . You see , even though you're not a good singer , people will listen to you . \",\" I wouldn't do that . \",\" But I like the feeling . \",\"What kind of music do you like ? \",\" I like popular music best . \",\" Me too . \",\" Who is your favorite singer ? \",\" Qi In is . \",\" Do you know this song ? \",\" Yes , I like it very much . \",\" Let's sing it together , shall we ? \",\" No problem . \",\"Who's it for ? \",\" It's for you . \",\"How much does this cost ? \",\" Sixty dollars . \",\"May I use your phone ? \",\" Go ahead . \",\"Where's the toilet ? \",\" Over there . \",\"Watch out , Jenny ! Be careful of the cars . \",\" I'm fine , dad . \",\" Did you get hit ? \",\" No , dad . Can I go there to play ball ? \",\" Watch out for strangers , and don't go too far away . Alright ? \",\"Do you shop online often ? \",\" Every so often .
